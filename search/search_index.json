We therefore need to mount the Target drive; specifically slice 3 of disk2.</p> Type sudo mount \u2013t hfs /dev/disk2s3 /Volumes/Target.

If a search for disk2 comes up empty, then you know it is the unmounted drive.     At this point, you have the choice of imaging the suspect\u2019s entire drive (recommended), or of just imaging the slice that you want. If you want to image the entire drive, type:\u00a0\u00a0   sudo dd if=/dev/disk1 bs=1024 conv=notrunc,noerror,sync of=/Volumes/Target/Evidence.dmg.   This will write a raw DD image to the root of Target and will name the image Evidence.dmg.  If you only want to image particular slices, then add the slice to the command, i.e.   sudo dd if=/dev/disk1s9 bs=1024 conv=notrunc,noerror,sync of=/Volumes/Target/Evidence.dmg.   A separate acquisition can be done for each slice that you want to examine by changing the slice number and giving each new image a different file name, i.e. EvidOS8.dmg.  The advantage of imaging the whole disk is that you can later bring it into Encase as a single evidence file.     9.  Your done.

For example, carving files usually results with the carved files copied out of the image for testing. If you image a RAID array separately you end up with 3-5 disk images and typically you will need to copy them into a logical image (unless your favourite software supports RAID reconstruction). When you copy a file out of the image using sleuthkit, you are actually copying bits of data directly from the image.</p> <p>All these copies are wasteful of disk space. They are also hard to manage because pretty soon you end up with lots of copies of the same data in different ways. There must be a better way!!!</p> <p>Now there is. By having the underlying forensic format doing all the mapping its possible to use tools which are not capable of doing these transformations themselves. This is all about tool reuse. For example suppose you have a carver which is used to work on dd images. But you want to use it on the virtual memory image of the firefox process. In the past you had to copy the virtual memory out (it could be 2-4gb) then run the carver on it, and possibly end up with about 3 or 4 copies of the same data - for each process address space!!!</p> <p>Its much easier to have volatility create the initial maps for each process (with zero storage overheads), and then carvers can just use the maps without understanding anything about memory forensics. In this way the AFF4 format is more of an interchange format - allowing tools to be used on the results from other tools.</p> <p>The map stream is an AFF4 object which contains a segment called map. Here is an example:</p> <p><code>1601536,0,urn:aff4:f3eba626-505a-4730-8216-1987853bc4d2</code> <code>1614848,12288,urn:aff4:f3eba626-505a-4730-8216-1987853bc4d2</code> <code>1879040,274432,urn:aff4:f3eba626-505a-4730-8216-1987853bc4d2</code> <code>2142208,536576,urn:aff4:f3eba626-505a-4730-8216-1987853bc4d2</code> <code>2405376,798720,urn:aff4:f3eba626-505a-4730-8216-1987853bc4d2</code> <code>2668544,1060864,urn:aff4:f3eba626-505a-4730-8216-1987853bc4d2</code> <code>2931712,1323008,urn:aff4:f3eba626-505a-4730-8216-1987853bc4d2</code></p> <p>This map was generated by sleuthkit for an ext2 file. The first number of the offset in the image. The second number is the offset in the file and the third number of the URN of the object to read from (the target). The above map basically says that the byte range from 0-12288 in the file should be read from aff4:f3eba626-505a-4730-8216-1987853bc4d2 offset 1601536 to 1614848, etc.</p> <p>Using the fsbuild tool its possible to create map streams for all files in an image at virtually zero storage requirements.

We do this by setting attributes on the map objects:</p> <p><code>aff4:block_size=64k</code> <code>aff4:stream_period=6</code> <code>aff4:target_period=3</code></p>","tags":["Articles that need to be expanded","Disk Image","File Formats"]},{"location":"aff4/#see-also","title":"See Also","text":"<ul> <li>Extending the Advanced Forensic Format to accommodate Multiple Data Sources, Logical Evidence, Arbitrary Information and Forensic Workflow,   by M.

In 1996 Gutmann asserted that it might be possible to recover overwritten data and proposed a 35-pass approach for assured sanitization (Gutmann 1996).

In particular a common mistake is the oversight of how the underlying file system actually stores files, for instance a 'wipe drive' application that will write a series of random values across unallocated space on the hard disk may not take into account the slack space at the end of allocated data blocks.

The term glyph describes how a character prints. A single character can have multiple glyphs (for example, glyphs with serifs and those without). A single glyph can have multiple characters. For example, in the font Helvetica the same shape is used to represent a lower case 'l' (ell) and a capital 'I' (eye).</p> <p>Unicode is set up as a catalog of nominal characters, independent and irrespective of the (computer) typographical consequences. For example, the English/US Unicode page has an entry for the character 'lower case a', but does not define how that letter should be displayed.</p> <p>PDF documents can contain both glyphs and characters. Modern PDFs emulate the 19th century-style metal-based typesetting process. Ideally PDFs should encode characters, not glyphs<sup>citation needed</sup>. When typesetting Arabic, Unicode is used as a glyph list, rather than a character list. The glyphs are used as indexes into a huge font book.</p> <p>By interpreting the Unicode standard as a look-up for glyph indexes, Unicode is abused as if it were a huge font book. This confuses multi-lingual encoding with computer typography.</p> <p>An underlying cause for this error is the idea that there can be such a thing as a Character-Glyph model. However, in the real world there is no connection between abstract characters and the glyphs used to represent them.</p> <p>Increasingly font designers are discovering the enormous conceptual freedom one gets without any Character-Glyph constraint. But Adobe still uses the Unicode standard to extract the nominal character values from the font glyph numbers used to represent them. That is why more advanced Arabic fonts that do not use the Unicode Presentation Blocks produce gibberish when text is extracted from the PDF.</p> <p>Future versions of PDF are planned to embed Unicode as text in addition to the font information, which would resolve this issue.</p> <p>Part of the problem is that Unicode\u2019s Arabic Presentation Blocks are officially deprecated by the Unicode Consortium. Their inclusion was at the time \u2013 late 1980\u2019s - a technical compromise to allow the ISO 10646 to join Unicode. As such the compromise was incomplete, as only 400 out of originally 4000 requested Arabic ligatures we allowed to remain in the Unicode Standard. Ironically, all the printed examples in the Unicode standard were designed by Thomas Milo based on computer-generated synthesis of the underlying letter block fusions of traditional Arabic \"Script Grammar\". This was done using DecoType\u2019s famous ACE technology, that eventually became the working model for Microsoft\u2019s True Type Open, the precursor of today's OpenType.</p> <p>Arabic Presentation Forms should never be encoded, such a practice amounts to reverting to Font Pages, whose very proliferation caused the development of a more intelligent alternative: Unicode.</p>","tags":["No Category"]},{"location":"arff/","title":"Arff","text":"<p>ARFF is the Attribute-Relation File Format</p>","tags":["File Formats","Articles that need to be expanded"]},{"location":"arff/#see-also","title":"See also","text":"<ul> <li>https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/arff.html</li> <li>ARFF to SQL Database   importer</li> </ul>","tags":["File Formats","Articles that need to be expanded"]},{"location":"argus/","title":"Argus","text":"","tags":["Network Forensics","Tools","Linux","Windows","MacOS","FreeBSD","OpenBSD","NetBSD","Open Source Software"]},{"location":"argus/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>argus is a network flow monitor that is used to establish network activity audits.

In many DIY efforts, snort, Bro and argus run on the same high performance device. The audit data that Argus generates is great for network forensics, non-repudiation, network asset and service inventory, behavioral baselining of server and client relationships, detecting very slow scans, and supporting Zero day events.

Snort creates a special   binary output format called unified. Barnyard reads this file, and   then resends the data to a database backend.

See here.</li> <li>Undocumented extended file mode of <code>-/-rrwxrwxrwx</code>. Characters <code>-/-</code> are appended to the body file entry and <code>r</code> file entry type indication, presumably to indicate a \"regular file\".</li> <li>Undocumented and inconsistent application of TSK metadata addresses. See here</li> <li>Undocumented and inconsistent application of owner identifier (UID). See here.</li> <li>Date and time values do not indicate a time zone or if daylight savings applies. Timestamps can be in either UTC or local time depending on the original file system.</li> <li>Body file encoding is not specified, UTF-8 is assumed.<ul> <li>It is unclear how \"invalid\" Unicode characters should be handled, such as unpaired surrogates in NTFS file names.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The name field can contain <code>($FILE_NAME)</code> to indicate the body file entry was derived from a NTFS <code>$FILE_NAME</code> attribute instead of <code>$STANDARD_INFORMATION</code> and <code>$DATA</code> attributes. Note that the exact behavior is not documented by the Sleuth Kit project.</li> <li>The <code>name</code> field can contain <code>-&gt; symbolic_link_target</code> but <code>fls</code> does not appear to support this for NTFS. Also see here.</li> <li>It is unclear if the symbolic link target can be used in combination with the <code>($FILE_NAME)</code> suffix.</li> <li>It is unclear which characters should be escaped, by observation <code>|</code>   and <code>\\</code> are both escaped with <code>\\</code> in the name field by <code>fls</code> but <code>mactime</code>   is unable to handle a name that contains the <code>|</code> character. See here. Note: Other implementations are known to not escape <code>\\</code>.</li> <li>It is unclear from the specification if control characters should be   escaped. See here. Other implementations are known to escape control characters as <code>x##</code> where <code>##</code> contains the hexadecimal byte value of the control character.</li> <li>The format of the <code>inode</code> field is unclear for file systems like NTFS, the documentation indicates that it uses a TSK Metadata Address, however by observation the implementation is TSK specific and does not seem to match what is documented. Also see here. Other implementations are known to store the 64-bit NTFS file reference value as the <code>inode</code> field.</li> <li>The format of the <code>mode_as_string</code> field is unclear for file systems like NTFS, this likely can be derived from the source code. Also see here.</li> <li>The Sleuth Kit currently does not correctly identify symbolic links for NTFS in the body file output. Also see here.</li> <li>The <code>atime</code>, <code>mtime</code>, <code>ctime</code>, and <code>crtime</code> typically contain the number of seconds since January 1, 1970. It is unknown if a fractional part is allowed by specification. The corresponding mactime tool does allow for a fractional part to be present but ignores it. Also see here. This limits the usefulness of the format for timelines with a vast amount of sub-second activity.</li> <li>The format of the MD5 field is undefined, however documentation indicates:<ul> <li>If hashing is disabled, the value will be <code>0</code>.</li> <li>If hashing is enabled, but no MD5 was calculated, the value will be <code>00000000000000000000000000000000</code>.

The results can be easily inspected, parsed, or processed with automated tools. bulk_extractor also creates a histograms of features that it finds, as features that are more common tend to be more important. The program can be used for law enforcement, defense, intelligence, and cyber-investigation applications.</p> <p>bulk_extractor is distinguished from other forensic tools by its speed and thoroughness. Because it ignores file system structure, bulk_extractor can process different parts of the disk in parallel. In practice, the program splits the disk up into 16MiByte pages and processes one page on each available core. This means that 24-core machines process a disk roughly 24 times faster than a 1-core machine. bulk_extractor is also thorough. That\u2019s because bulk_extractor automatically detects, decompresses, and recursively re-processes compressed data that is compressed with a variety of algorithms. Our testing has shown that there is a significant amount of compressed data in the unallocated regions of file systems that is missed by most forensic tools that are commonly in use today.</p> <p>Another advantage of ignoring file systems is that bulk_extractor can be used to process any digital media. We have used the program to process hard drives, SSDs, optical media, camera cards, cell phones, network packet dumps, and other kinds of digital information.</p>","tags":["Tools","Disk Analysis","Open Source Software","Windows","Linux","MacOS"]},{"location":"bulk_extractor/#output-feature-files","title":"Output Feature Files","text":"<p>bulk_extractor now creates an output directory that includes:</p> <ul> <li>ccn.txt -- Credit card numbers</li> <li>ccn_track2.txt -- Credit card \u201ctrack 2\u2033 information</li> <li>domain.txt -- Internet domains found on the drive, including   dotted-quad addresses found in text.</li> <li>email.txt -- Email addresses</li> <li>ether.txt -- Ethernet MAC addresses found through IP packet   carving of swap files and compressed system hibernation files and file   fragments.</li> <li>exif.txt -- EXIFs from JPEGs and video segments.

This can be used to infer the user\u2019s activities within a time period.</p> <p>cda_tool.py This tool, currently under development, reads multiple bulk_extractor reports from multiple runs against multiple drives and performs a multi-drive correlation using Garfinkel\u2019s Cross Drive Analysis technique.

The program takes as input a bulk_extractor feature file and a DFXML file containing the locations of each file on the drive (produced with Garfinkel\u2019s fiwalk program) and produces an annotated feature file that contains the offset, feature, and the file in which the feature was found.</p> <p>make_context_stop_list.py Although forensic analysts frequently make \u201cstop lists\u201d\u2014for example, a list of email addresses that appear in the operating system and should therefore be ignored\u2014such lists have a significant problem. Because it is relatively easy to get an email address into the binary of an open source application, ignoring all of these email addresses may make it possible to cloak email addresses from forensic analysis. Our solution is to create context-sensitive stop lists, in which the feature to be stopped is presented with the context in which it occurs. The make_context_stop_list.py program takes the results of multiple bulk_extractor runs and creates a single context-sensitive stop list that can then be used to suppress features when found in a specific context.

Rob J Meijer</p> <p>Simsong 06:29, 3 November 2008 (UTC) The problem with using carvfs is that this adds another dependency. Do you really want to require that people install carvfs in order to run the carver? What about having the thing ported to Windows?</p> <p>Rob J Meijer I would support adding one build dependency (libcarvpath) and removing two (libewf/libaff) by moving them to a layer more suited for them (carvfs) that would possibly allow some form of file handle (as cap) based POLA design. I am a proponent of making small things that do one and do one thing right, and to stack those to do what you need. In my view that would lead ideally to the following (simplified) chain:</p> <ul> <li>recursive computer forensics   framework</li> <li>The-(pola-based)-carving-tool<ul> <li>The-carving-lib working on open fd's.</li> <li>libcarvpath<ul> <li>carvfs (Over cifs/nfs-v4 on platforms that don't support   Fuse).</li> <li>libewf</li> <li>libaff</li> </ul> </li> <li>AppArmor (on supporting platforms)</li> <li>suid (on supporting platforms)</li> <li>iptables/ipfw (on supporting platforms)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>As fow windows support, I would imagine making carvfs run over smb would come a long way, that is for as far as windows support is all that relevant.</p> <p>There are two advantages to using libcarvpath and carvfs instead of libaff/libewf t this layer:</p> <ul> <li>storage requirements for doing carving. Beyond what sleuthkit or   alternatives provide I have seen many situations where carving was not   done due to storage limitations.</li> <li>File handles are like object capabilities. You can often do pretty   simple POLA based implementations using file handles and something   like AppArmor. POLA could IMHO be a strong weapon against the more   nasty forms of anti forensics.</li> </ul> <p>Next to this, I would consider making different tools for different stages instead of one semi recursive one, and looking at how to integrate these tools into existing frameworks (ocfa/pyflag).</p> <p>Keep things simple but rigid and try to easily integrate things into existing frameworks as effectively as possible I would suggest.</p> <p>Please note, I am not ptoposing the lib/tool should be useless without libcarvpath, only that usage without carvfs should limit the</p> <p>supported image formats to raw images, and that libewf/libaff should be abstracted at the Fuse level or below and not at the tool level.</p> <p>Joachim do you have an idea what the performance impact of this approach would be? It might be wise to do a proof of concept for this approach first.</p> <p>Rob J Meijer It would I think depend greatly on behavior of the carving lib/tool. Small 512 byte reads are relatively very expensive, 128kb reads have negligible impact. There are some numbers from ntfs-3g that might be relevant. More relevant than performance might be library footprint. For example, using OCFA, we often would want to keep e few hundred images that total to tens of TB of projected storage size fuse mounted.

Making the revit configuration I learned you'll need a near programming language to specify some file formats. A simple descriptive language is too limiting. I would also go for 2 bytes with endianess instead of using terminology like WORD and small integer, it's much more clear. The configuration also needs to deal with aspects like cardinality, required and optional structures.</p> <p>This is simply data structures carving, see ideas above.

RB</p> <p>I guess this tool operates like Selective file dumper and can recover files in both ways (or not?). Recovering files by using carving can recover files in situations where sleuthkit does nothing (e.g. file on NTFS was deleted using ntfs-3g, or filesystem was destroyed or just unknown). And we should build the list of filesystems supported by carver, not by TSK. .FUF</p> <p>This tool is still in the early planning stages (requirements discovery), hence few operational details (like precise modes of operation) have been fleshed out - those will and should come later. The justification for strictly using TSK for the filesystem-sensitive approach is simple: TSK has good filesystem APIs, and it would be foolish to create yet another standalone, incompatible implementation of filesystem(foo) when time would be better spent improving those in TSK, aiding other methods of analysis as well. This is the same reason individuals that have implemented several other carvers are participating: de-duplication of effort. RB</p> <p>Joachim A design problem might be that TSK currently is a single library operating on multiple layers (storage media IO, volume/partition analysis and file system analysis).

It makes use of a fairly standard PC system but connects directly to the source drive (the drive being imaged.) Through this hardware connection, it is able to command the source drive on a low ATA register level. It thus bypasses normal BIOS calls to the hard drive. Standard BIOS / hard drive operations will not allow the retrieval of damaged or corrupted sectors as it would invariably cause a system (OS) failure. For data recovery purposes however, it is important to be able to access any available data.</p> <p>Additionally, the DeepSpar Disk Imager controls the power input of the source drive so that it can, if required, re-power the source without rebooting the system. (This is significant with highly unstable drives that will continually \u201chang.\u201d)</p> <p>To control and pre-configure the source drive, the DeepSpar Disk Imager makes use of specific ATA commands 1 as well as some vendor specific commands. This includes the ability to read sectors while ignoring ECC errors as well as the ability to send software and hardware reset commands to the drive which creates the ability to control \u201cread timeout.\u201d (Read timeout is a user defined amount of time in milliseconds that the hard drive will be given to read any particular sector. If the read timeout is reached before the sector is correctly read, it will be skipped. The imager then marks in its \u201cmap\u201d that the sector was skipped so that it can be reprocessed on later passes.)</p> <p>Through the tool\u2019s software interface, the end user is able to configure all parameters and commands that they wish the imager to use over multiple imaging passes. As previously mentioned, the DeepSpar Disk Imager stores a \u201cmap\u201d of all the sectors from the source drive. This map allows the imager to always remember which sectors have been imaged, which were skipped, and which had errors etc. This in turn allows the imager to run multiple passes without reprocessing sectors that had been previous read correctly. It also allows the imager run imaging passes to target specific sector errors.</p> <p>Unlike forensics tools, the DeepSpar Disk Imager does not create an image file. Instead, it uses commands and techniques to image all sectors on the source drive directly to the destination drive. The image drive can then be used by any data retrieval or forensics software for file recovery or forensics investigation.</p>","tags":["Disk Imaging","Tools","Hardware"]},{"location":"deepspar_disk_imager/#external-links","title":"External Links","text":"<ul> <li>Official website</li> <li>Product data   sheet</li> <li>Review of the DeepSpar Disk   Imager by Mike   Montgomery of MJM Data Recovery in the UK.</li> <li>Disk Imaging: A Vital Step in Data   Recovery,   a whitepaper on the product</li> <li>Interview on the   imager on the   Cyberspeak podcast</li> </ul>","tags":["Disk Imaging","Tools","Hardware"]},{"location":"defense_computer_forensics_lab/","title":"Defense computer forensics lab","text":"<p>The Defense Computer Forensics Lab (DCFL) is located in Linthicum, Maryland.

As a result, they advocate applying the voodoo to PRML and EPRML drives even though it will have no more effect than a simple scrubbing with random data. In fact performing the full 35-pass overwrite is pointless for any drive since it targets a blend of scenarios involving all types of (normally-used) encoding technology, which covers everything back to 30+-year-old MFM methods (if you don't understand that statement, re-read the paper). If you're using a drive which uses encoding technology X, you only need to perform the passes specific to X, and you never need to perform all 35 passes. For any modern PRML/EPRML drive, a few passes of random scrubbing is the best you can do. As the paper says, \"A good scrubbing with random data will do about as well as can be expected\". This was true in 1996, and is still true now.</p> <p>Looking at this from the other point of view, with the ever-increasing data density on disk platters and a corresponding reduction in feature size and use of exotic techniques to record data on the medium, it's unlikely that anything can be recovered from any recent drive except perhaps one or two levels via basic error-cancelling techniques. In particular the the drives in use at the time that this paper was originally written have mostly fallen out of use, so the methods that applied specifically to the older, lower-density technology don't apply any more. Conversely, with modern high-density drives, even if you've got 10KB of sensitive data on a drive and can't erase it with 100% certainty, the chances of an adversary being able to find the erased traces of that 10KB in 80GB of other erased traces are close to zero.''</p> <p>https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.html</p>","tags":["Articles that need to be expanded"]},{"location":"epoch/","title":"Epoch","text":"<p>tags:   * Articles that need to be expanded</p> <p>The phrase Epoch is commonly used to describe the date and time that is represented by the number \"0\".</p> <p>The following Epochs are known:</p> Applications Date and Time Reference Microsoft Windows January 1, 1601 UTC File Times Unix File Systems January 1, 1970 UTC Apple File Systems January 1, 1904 UTC Palm OS January 1, 1904 UTC"},{"location":"eraser/","title":"Eraser","text":"<p>Eraser is a Windows tool that allows you to securely remove files from your computers hard drive and securely wipe free space so as to remove the residual data of previously deleted files by overwriting with specially selected wiping paterns.</p> <p>Eraser currently works with Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, Windows 2003 Server and DOS and supports FAT and NTFS formatted IDE/SATA/SCSI hard drives.

Every sector has a standard 512 bytes of user data. A typical ECC is capable of correcting between 10 and 12 bytes. If repairing the corruption is beyond the capability of the ECC, the data will not be returned to the operating system. The drive will then return an error.

However, searching the entire input can find files that have been embedded into other files, such as JPEGs being embedded into Microsoft Word documents.

This method assumes that each block can only be part of a single file (or embedded file).</p> <p>Statistical Carving Any carving method (algorithm) that analyzes the input on characteristic or statistic for example, entropy) to determine if the input is part of a possible output file.</p> <p>Header/Footer Carving A method for carving files out of raw data using a distinct header (start of file marker) and footer (end of file marker).</p> <p>Header/Maximum (file) size Carving A method for carving files out of raw data using a distinct header (start of file marker) and a maximum (file) size. This approach works because many file formats (e.g. JPEG, MP3) do not care if additional junk is appended to the end of a valid file.</p> <p>Header/Embedded Length Carving A method for carving files out of raw data using a distinct header and a file length (size) which is embedded in the file format</p> <p>File structure based Carving A method for carving files out of raw data using a certain level of knowledge of the internal structure of file types. Garfinkel called this approach \"Semantic Carving\" in his DFRWS2006 carving challenge submission, while Metz and Mora called the approach \"Deep Carving.\"</p> <p>Semantic Carving A method for carving files based on a linguistic analysis of the file's content. For example, a semantic carver might conclude that six blocks of french in the middle of a long HTML file written in English is a fragment left from a previous allocated file, and not from the English-language HTML file.</p> <p>Carving with Validation A method for carving files out of raw data where the carved files are validated using a file type specific validator.</p> <p>Fragment Recovery Carving A carving method in which two or more fragments are reassembled to form the original file or object. Garfinkel previously called this approach \"Split Carving.\"</p> <p>Repackaging Carving A carving method that modifies the extracted data by adding new headers, footers, or other information so that it can be viewed with standard utilities.

The hashes were computed using SHA1, MD5, CRC64, and CRC32 algorithms and hash collisions of sectors from JPEG and WAV files to other sectors were recorded. The analysis of the results shows that although MD5 and SHA1 produce no false-positive indications, the occurrence of false positives is relatively low for CRC32 and especially CRC64. Furthermore, the CRC-based algorithms produce considerably smaller hashes than SHA1 and MD5, thereby requiring smaller storage capacities. CRC64 provides a good compromise between number of collisions and storage capacity required for practical implementations of sector-scanning forensic tools.\",</p> <p><code>url=\"</code><code>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15567280802050436</code><code>\"</code></p> <p>} </p>","tags":["Bibliographies"]},{"location":"file_carving_bibliography/#evaluations","title":"Evaluations","text":"<ul> <li>Measuring and Improving the Quality of File Carving Methods   by S.J.J.

It has gained some support for Linux and MacOS file systems but remains something that is used primarily in the Windows environment.</p> <p>Red Book The original definition of audio CDs was distributed with a red cover, hence the term \"Red Book\". This is not properly a file system as it does not define files, file names or any metadata. It is the definition by which music discs are created.</p> <p>Rock Ridge Rock Ridge is a set of extensions based on the System Use Sharing Protocol or SUSP definition. It is a method by which POSIX file attributes, including very long file names, can be applied to optical media. Today it is only really supported by Linux and other Unix-derived operating systems.</p> <p>UDF UDF is the acronym for Universal Disk Format which was defined by the Optical Storage Technology Association as an implementable subset of ISO 13346. It is part of the definition for DVD Video and DVD Audio discs as well as being used by a number of drag-and-drop disc writing programs. It is supported for reading by Windows 98 and later versions and is supported beginning with OS 9 on the Macintosh. Both Windows Vista and Windows 7 can write discs using this as either a \"mastered\" format with a static, read-only file system or as a \"live\" file system which can be updated on both write-once and rewritable media.</p>","tags":["Anti-Forensics","Disk Encryption","Encryption","File Systems","Linux","MacOS","Windows"]},{"location":"file_systems/#distributed-file-systems","title":"Distributed File Systems","text":"<p>Distributed file systems, also known as network file systems, allow any number of remote clients to access one or more servers which store the files.

File system drivers use the interface to the block device layer to perform internal write operations, and the block device layer is ignoring (not checking) the read-only flag set by hdparm or blockdev on a block device, therefore it's up to a file system driver to refuse writing to a block device in read-only mode (and there is nothing stopping write operations issued by a file system driver not adhering the read-only mode of a block device due to the lack of read-only flag checks).

Calculating and retaining hashes of the files you gather during your investigation (whether they be script output or actual binaries) is a great way to prove that your collected evidence hasn't been tampered with. Because of the risk of hash collisions, it is important to use multiple hashing algorithms for each file (e.g., MD5 and SHA1).</p> <p>GetHashes.sh is a simple bash script that quickly calculates MD5 and SHA1 hashes for all files in the same directory as the script. This is much quicker and simpler than running the hashing commands manually for each file. The script is used by placing the script in the same folder as the files to hash, and then running the script. This will produce two folders of hashes, one of MD5, and one of SHA1 hashes. These can be used at a later time as evidence that the forensic data has not been tampered with. The script also ignores itself and any directories located in the same directory (to avoid errors when trying to hash directories).

This allows the forensic examiner to remove the SD card and make a backup with a write blocked SD card reader. The most important file for the forensic examiner will be the CFG file that is held in the map data directory. This holds a list of all recent destinations that the user has entered into the device. The information is held in a hex file and stores the grid coordinates of these locations.</p> <p>Certain TomTom models (Go 510, Go 910, Go 920 etc.) allow the user to pair their mobile phone to the device so they can use the TomTom as a hands free kit. If the user has paired their phone to the TomTom device, then the TomTom will store the Bluetooth MAC ID for up to five phones, erasing the oldest if a sixth phone is paired. Depending on the phone model paired with the TomTom, there may also be Call lists, contacts and text messages (sent &amp; received) stored in the device too.</p> <p>The newer TomTom models do not appear as a mass storage device when connected to Windows. They run a Linux operating system and are only accessed via their built in Webserver using the myTomTom program (a replacement for TomTomHome). They cannot currently by examined forensically.</p> <p>Another tool for forensically analysing TomToms is TomTology. This will retrieve all journey details from both live and unallocated space. It will tell you which is the home, favourites and recent destinations and will also tell you the last journey that was plotted and where the TomTom last had a GPS fix. It will also extract phone numbers if the device has been paired with a phone and will find deleted phone numbers, useful for potentially tracing a previous owner. As of 2012, TomTology has been superseded by TomTology2. This new program has the same functionality as TomTology but also deals with Garmins (live and deleted) and Navmans. It also include inbuilt mapping.</p>","tags":["No Category"]},{"location":"global_positioning_system/#garmin","title":"Garmin","text":"<p>Garmin units connect to a PC in the same way as TomTom, via a USB cable.

He has written several books and tools focusing on Windows systems and incident response. His Windows Incident Response Blog Harlan Carvey's interest in computer and information security began while he was an officer in the U.S. military, and a student at the Naval Postgraduate School, earning his MSEE. After leaving military service, he began working in the field of commercial and government information security consulting, performing vulnerability assessments and penetration tests. While employed at one company, he was the sole developer of a program for collecting security-specific information (i.e., Registry entries, file information, configuration settings, etc.) from Windows NT systems during vulnerability assessments. The purpose of the product was to overcome shortfalls in commercial scanning products and provide more valuable information to the customer. Harlan has also done considerable work in the area of incident response and forensics, performing internal and external investigations. He has also written a number of proof-of-concept tools for educating users in such topics as Windows null sessions, file signature analysis, and the retrieval of metadata from a variety of file formats. Harlan's experience with computers began in the early '80s, with a Timex-Sinclair 1000. Around that time, he was learning to program BASIC on an Apple IIe. From there, he moved on to computers such as the Epson QX-10 and the TRS-80, on which he programmed BASIC and learned some rudimentary PASCAL, using the TurboPASCAL compiler. Since then, he's worked with SunOS and Solaris systems, as well as various versions of DOS and Windows, OS/2, and Linux. Harlan has presented at a variety of computer security conferences, including Usenix, DefCon9, Black Hat, GMU2003/HTCIA/RCFG, WACCI, and PFIC2010. He has discussed various topics specific to issues on Windows platforms, such as data hiding, incident response, and forensic analysis. He has had articles published in the Information Security Bulletin, on the SecurityFocus website, and in the Hakin9 magazine. Finally, Harlan has written a number of open source programs (including RegRipper), which have been made available online and via CDs/DVDs in his books. His Windows Incident Response blog is updated on a regular basis.</p>","tags":["People"]},{"location":"harlan_carvey/#website","title":"Website","text":"<ul> <li>Harlan's Windows Incident Response Blog</li> </ul>","tags":["People"]},{"location":"harlan_carvey/#tools","title":"Tools","text":"<ul> <li>WinForensicAnalysis Tools -   Hosted on Google Code, includes files for the Windows Registry   Forensics book.</li> </ul>","tags":["People"]},{"location":"harlan_carvey/#books","title":"Books","text":"<ul> <li>Windows Registry Forensics</li> <li>Windows Forensic Analysis</li> <li>Windows Forensics and Incident Recovery</li> <li>Perl Scripting for Windows Security</li> <li>A Study of Video Teleconferencing Traffic on a TCP/IP Network</li> </ul>","tags":["People"]},{"location":"harvard_forensics_project/","title":"Harvard forensics project","text":"<p>The Disk Forensics Project was previously hosted at the Center for Research on Computation and Society (CRCS) at Harvard University.</p>","tags":["No Category"]},{"location":"harvard_forensics_project/#project-coordinator","title":"Project Coordinator","text":"<ul> <li>Simson L.

According to the research by T\u00c3\u00b3th and Spala, in some versions of Android the key is located in the last 16K of the encrypted userdata partition. In other Android versions the key is located in /efs/metadata. For these cases, their 'sandy' framework can locate your key quite effectively.</p> <p>In the case of the testing below, the phone was a Samsung SII SGH-T989D running Android 4.1.2 (with an encryption passphrase of 'test123'). The key in this case was not located in the userdata partition nor /efs/metadata so we manually searched for the ASCII string 'aes-cbc-essiv:sha256' using grep (or the tool of your choice) to locate it. The 'DumpData.bin' is a single 16GB raw image which was acquired from the device.</p> <p><code>dk@anubis:~/Samsung_SII_SGHT989D$\u00a0strings\u00a0-t\u00a0d\u00a0DumpData.bin\u00a0|\u00a0grep\u00a0aes-cbc-essiv:sha256</code> <code>402653220\u00a0aes-cbc-essiv:sha256</code> <code>663743397\u00a0aes-cbc-essiv:sha256</code></p> <p>Let's check the first hit, is that the key? It is! You can tell as the key area we need starts with 0xC5B1B5D0, contains some \"whitespace\", then the 'aes-cbc-essiv:sha256', followed by more \"whitespace\", and finally the encryption key or encrypted footer which starts with 0xF1DA84CF in our case and is 80 bytes in length. Ultimately, these 80 bytes are all that we want to extract and brute force with JtR. If you want to skip ahead slightly, at this point you could select those 80 hex bytes, save them to a file in JtF format, and start brute forcing with JtR. These steps are covered in more detail below.</p> <p>Note: The starting 0xC5B1B5D0 bytes were noted to vary slightly between different Android dumps however the variations were minor. Just note that a search for '0xC5B1B5D0' will not always work hence why we search for 'aes-cbc-essiv:sha256'.</p> <p>In this example we are using 'dd' to extract 512 bytes around the area where our ASCII string was located. In order to show the entire match including the 0xC5B1B5D0 starting point, I am skipping back 36 bytes before the ASCII string hit. 36 is an arbitrary number which is enough in this case to show the starting 0xC5B1B5D0 which is indicative of the start of the area which contains the encryption key.</p> <p><code>dk@anubis:~/Samsung_SII_SGHT989D$\u00a0dd\u00a0bs=1\u00a0skip=$((402653220-36))\u00a0count=512\u00a0if=DumpData.bin\u00a0|\u00a0hexdump\u00a0-C</code> <code>00000000\u00a0\u00a0c5\u00a0b1\u00a0b5\u00a0d0\u00a001\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a0\u00a0d8\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a0\u00a0|................|</code> <code>00000010\u00a0\u00a020\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a0\u00a000\u00a010\u00a040\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0.........@.....|</code> <code>00000020\u00a0\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a061\u00a065\u00a073\u00a02d\u00a0\u00a063\u00a062\u00a063\u00a02d\u00a065\u00a073\u00a073\u00a069\u00a0\u00a0|....aes-cbc-essi|</code> <code>00000030\u00a0\u00a076\u00a03a\u00a073\u00a068\u00a061\u00a032\u00a035\u00a036\u00a0\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a0\u00a0|v:sha256........|</code> <code>00000040\u00a0\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a0\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a0\u00a0|................|</code> <code>*</code> <code>00000060\u00a0\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a0b1\u00a0e4\u00a001\u00a010\u00a0\u00a002\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a0\u00a0|................|</code> <code>00000070\u00a0\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a0\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a0\u00a0|................|</code> <code>00000080\u00a0\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a0f1\u00a0da\u00a084\u00a0cf\u00a0\u00a00f\u00a082\u00a030\u00a0b9\u00a0a7\u00a0bc\u00a016\u00a0d4\u00a0\u00a0|..........0.....|</code> <code>00000090\u00a0\u00a0bc\u00a0ed\u00a022\u00a020\u00a043\u00a06d\u00a07c\u00a0b7\u00a0\u00a050\u00a0aa\u00a0a3\u00a0f2\u00a06f\u00a041\u00a0d3\u00a028\u00a0\u00a0|..\"\u00a0Cm|.P...oA.(|</code> <code>000000a0\u00a0\u00a048\u00a0cc\u00a063\u00a00d\u00a010\u00a030\u00a0ae\u00a035\u00a0\u00a0b6\u00a0e3\u00a073\u00a0b2\u00a05c\u00a01c\u00a061\u00a0dd\u00a0\u00a0|H.c..0.5..s.\\.a.|</code> <code>000000b0\u00a0\u00a034\u00a080\u00a007\u00a089\u00a067\u00a034\u00a02e\u00a047\u00a0\u00a023\u00a068\u00a020\u00a0ac\u00a0df\u00a0cf\u00a041\u00a03a\u00a0\u00a0|4...g4.G#h\u00a0...A:|</code> <code>000000c0\u00a0\u00a010\u00a00c\u00a02d\u00a0f4\u00a018\u00a09e\u00a050\u00a0a0\u00a0\u00a047\u00a009\u00a0ca\u00a05c\u00a090\u00a01d\u00a042\u00a084\u00a0\u00a0|..-...P.G..\\..B.|</code> <code>000000d0\u00a0\u00a08a\u00a048\u00a062\u00a07c\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a0\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a0\u00a0|.Hb|............|</code> <code>000000e0\u00a0\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a0\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a0\u00a0|................|</code> <code>*</code> <code>00000200</code> <code>512+0\u00a0records\u00a0in</code> <code>512+0\u00a0records\u00a0out</code> <code>512\u00a0bytes\u00a0(512\u00a0B)\u00a0copied,\u00a00.00276768\u00a0s,\u00a0185\u00a0kB/s</code></p> <p>For fun, let's check the second hit from our previous strings + grep search.

Copying entire images over networks is often impossible due to the sheer size of the image. If you must ship disks, here are some instructions:</p> <ol> <li>Never ship the original drive (unless necessary for legal reasons).     Regardless of the ultimate disposition of the original drive, always     start by shipping an image.</li> <li>Use one of the Write Blockers mentioned     on this page. The write blocker goes on the original drive to ensure     that nothing is changed on the drive by the host OS of the imaging     workstation.</li> <li>A drive can be imaged by a number of free software     tools, such as FTK     Imager. Some of these tools compress and/or     encrypt data; I recommend both, as you don't want someone getting     their hands on your data, and if you have multiple images to send,     you can put them on one, say, 1TB drive.</li> <li>Image to a bare (internal) hard drive, such as these internal hard     drives.</li> <li>To write to the image drive use either a Firewire/USB2/eSATA     docks     or USB2/eSATA     docks.     I recommend getting two of these.</li> <li>Keep the original drive safe and intact (and unshipped) until you     verify that the image has been received intact.</li> <li>In addition, keep a copy of the images, if possible. This will     double your image storage needs, but if you are doing this     regularly, you don't want to have to re-image the drives, and I     guarantee that failures will occur if you do this long enough. Also,     you may have concerns about this original drive, as it may fail.</li> <li>ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS SHIP PROPERLY! Don't ship a drive in an     enclosure, as these provide minimal protection, and the drive     interface is plugged into something that can move. Not a good idea.     Take the drives out of the enclosure (if there is one - if you've     followed my advice above, you're working with images on bare     drives). Then get either a hard drive shipping kit, if you are     shipping multiple drives, or a single drive case.     If you can't do this, wrap the drive in foam sheeting or bubble wrap     (three times is good), and tape up the wrapped drive. If you don't     have access to any other packing material, then use towels or other     thick cloth. The key is something to absorb impact when the package     is inevitably dropped.</li> <li>Make sure you properly unmount the drive from the imaging station     before you disconnect it. If you don't know how<ul> <li>Ejecting Media on a   Mac</li> <li>Ejecting Media on   Windows</li> <li>Ejecting Media on   Linux</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>NB 1: This is advice, not a set of rules. Do what you can to secure your media and data.</p> <p>NB 2: This does NOT take account of chain-of-evidence issues, obviously.

Place battery back on phone and power on.</p> <p>Why am I unable to read an iDEN non-SIM based phone?</p> <p>iDEN Phonebook Manager only supports phones that utilize the SIM card technology. You must create a NEW phonebook list to have the capability of editing your SIM based phonebook.</p> <p>Do I need to install USB drivers when running the application with a USB cable?</p> <p>USB communications is available with iDEN Phonebook Manager. USB is compatible with the iDEN Phonebook Manager with the following Windows platforms: Windows 98 SE, Windows 2000, Windows ME and Windows XP. Important! It is very important that the software is installed first before connecting the USB cable. Failure to do so could result in the application not being able to read the phone. If you have installed the USB cable before installing the software, please remove the cable and install the application. Once installed you can re-insert the cable.</p> <p>What is an Append?</p> <p>During Copy Phonebook operation, the iDEN Phonebook Manager will attach the source data (phone list) that was selected from a file or from a phone and add it to the existing phone list in the Target phone during programming. This function can be particularly useful when data from two different files need to be merged. In the event that there are two files that contain the same phone (meaning both files are the same), the user will be given the option to replace the existing information, or keep the current file as it without appending anything to it.</p> <p>What if I receive the error message Cannot Communicate with the Phone?</p> <p>If you have trouble communicating to the phone, please review the following steps:</p> <p>1. Select \u2018Options\u2019 from the Main Menu screen.</p> <p>2. The \u2018communication settings\u2019 window will display the selected cable (Serial/USB).</p> <p>3. Connect the phone to the cable. Make sure you have a charged battery and the phone is powered on.</p> <p>4. If you are using a USB cable, please make sure that \u2018USB\u2019 is selected in the Communication Settings panel.</p> <p>5. If you are using a Serial cable, please make sure that \u2018Serial\u2019 is selected and the proper Com Port is selected.</p> <p>6. Once the Serial or USB cable communication is selected, test the communication by locating and pressing the \u2018Test\u2019 button.</p> <p>7. If a successfully communication is made between your computer and the phone, a successful message will be displayed.</p> <p>8. If you receive a message Unable to communicate with phone, please go back and verify the type of communication (Serial/USB). If Serial cable is selected, please be sure to choose the correct Com Port, and repeat test.</p> <p>Special Note:</p> <p>If using a Serial cable to communicate with the phone, please be sure to disable any applications that run in the background and utilize the Com Port. This will prevent you from reading the phone successfully. These applications interfere with the Com Port and will not allow the iDEN Phonebook Manager to communicate with the phone. For example, applications used to sync handheld devices, back up power supplies etc... Also make sure that your phones baud rate is set for AUTO to ensure proper communication to the PC.</p>","tags":["No Category"]},{"location":"identifying_file_systems/","title":"Identifying file systems","text":"<p>There are many ways to identify a file system inside a partition.</p> <p>When an operating system attempts to mount a partition, it may use the ID from the partition table.</p> <p>There are several tools that can identify the partition from the data it contains, including:</p> <ul> <li>blkid</li> <li>file</li> <li>parted</li> <li>testdisk</li> </ul> <p>In general you should not rely on the partition record for determining the partition type.</p> <p>Some of the test images created for the Honeynet Challenges have multiple file systems contained in a single partition.</p>","tags":["File Systems"]},{"location":"ilook/","title":"Ilook","text":"<p>ILooK was the digital forensic analysis tool used in the investigation of the 9/11 attacks.

Devices in the iPod family provide a simple user interface designed around a central scroll wheel (with the exception of the iPod shuffle). The standard iPod model stores media on a built-in hard drive, while the smaller iPod shuffle and iPod nano use flash memory. Like most digital audio players, an iPod can serve as an external data storage device when connected to a computer.</p>","tags":["Hardware","Personal Devices"]},{"location":"ipod/#software-capabilities","title":"Software Capabilities","text":"<p>The iPod can play MP3, WAV, M4A/AAC LC, Protected AAC, AIFF, Audible audiobook and Apple Lossless audio file formats. The fifth-generation iPod can also play .m4v and .mp4 MPEG-4 video file formats. The Microsoft Windows version of iTunes can transcode regular non copy-protected WMA files to an iPod supported format. WMA files with copy protection cannot be played in iTunes or be copied to an iPod. Reviewers have criticized the iPod's inability to play some other formats, in particular the Ogg Vorbis and FLAC formats. MIDI files cannot be played on iPods, but can be converted into a compatible audio file format by choosing the \"advanced\" menu on iTunes.</p> <p>Apple designed the iPod to work with the iTunes media library software, which lets users manage the music libraries on their computers and on their iPods. iTunes can automatically synchronize a user's iPod with specific playlists or with the entire contents of a music library each time an iPod connects to a host computer. Users may also set a rating (out of 5 stars) on any song, and can synchronize that information to an iTunes music library. Apart from iTunes there are also several third-party applications available that can be used to transfer songs to the iPod. iTunes lacks the ability to transfer songs from iPod to computer because of legality issues, although there are third party programs that circumvent Apple's protection.</p> <p>In addition to playing music and storing files, the iPod has limited PDA functionality. Since January 2003, Mac users have been able to synchronize their contacts and schedules Address Book and iCal to their iPods through iSync. With the 2005 release of iTunes 5.0, Apple integrated contact/schedule syncing into iTunes and added the ability for Windows users to synchronize their contacts and schedules from Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express. Although Mozilla Calendar and Mozilla Sunbird iCalendar have the same file format used by iCal and the iPod, there is no way to automatically sync schedules among these programs. However the files can be manually dragged and dropped into the correct directory on the iPod.</p> <p>The limited PDA calendar functions of the iPod are somewhat tainted for users from Newfoundland and parts of Australia. Their time zones are excluded from the iPod's firmware, leaving them unable to properly sync calendar events and alarms to their devices. No workaround (including mentally converting times when reading them) is functionally acceptable due to the combined behaviours of iSync, iCal and the iPod with regards to converting events between time zones. Apple has yielded no commitment to correct this problem as of January,2006.</p> <p>iPod can also display notes, and hence host simple games and store restaurant information. However, iPod has limitations as a PDA, since users cannot edit this information on the iPod except through a computer.</p>","tags":["Hardware","Personal Devices"]},{"location":"ipod/#models","title":"Models","text":"<p>Apple currently markets three distinct players bearing the iPod name.

Array of header value pairs <p>A value pair is variable of size and consists of:</p> Offset Size Value Description 0 2 Header value identifier string size 2 size Header value identifier string ... 2 Header value string size ... size Header value string <p>For the example above the size of the URL string can be found at offset 130 (0x82). The first 4 string values to extract from this data are prefaced with their lengths (or sizes) as 16-bit big-endian values. E.g. to retrieve the original URL string, read the WORD at offset 0x82, and translate it as a big-endian value (e.g. using Perl, unpack(\"n\",\\$data)). Beginning at offset 0x84, the string is 57 (0x39) bytes long. At the end of that string, the next WORD is the length of the third string, also in big-endian format.</p> <p>Once you've completed reading the initial 4 strings, there is a DWORD value which can be interpreted as the number of header values, followed by the individual header value definitions. Each header value definition consists of an identifier and a value string. Both strings are prefaced by a 16-bit big-endian (2-byte) value, containing the length of the string.</p> <p>In many cases, the first header value contains the HTTP Response code of 302. Other header values (that have been observed so far) include a response of 200, as well as additional data (including time stamps), and the *.idx files themselves appear to contain certificate (and perhaps other) information.</p>","tags":["Analysis"]},{"location":"java/#external-links","title":"External Links","text":"<ul> <li>Tracing and Logging,   by Oracle</li> <li>Almost Cooked UP Some Java</li> <li>Finding Initial Infection Vector</li> <li>Java IDX Format Specification,   by Mark Woan, January 2013</li> <li>Java Malware - Identification and Analysis,   by Brian Baskin, January 12, 2013</li> <li>Java Web Vulnerability Mitigation on Windows,   by Tim Johnson, May 23, 2013</li> <li>The State of Java Reversing Tools,   by Brian Baskin, September 3, 2013</li> </ul>","tags":["Analysis"]},{"location":"jesse_kornblum/","title":"Jesse kornblum","text":"<p>Jesse Kornblum is a computer forensics author, researcher and engineer.</p>","tags":["People"]},{"location":"jesse_kornblum/#tools","title":"Tools","text":"<p>md5deep and hashdeep - Cross platform recursive hashing and auditing programs, respectively.

In the embedded processor market, essentially all modern processors support JTAG when they have enough pins. Embedded systems development relies on debuggers talking to chips with JTAG to perform operations like single stepping and breakpointing.

Since you can specify any number of volumes of the command line you can see that libaff4 first tries to open the volume as a directory volume, if that fails, it tries to open it as a zip file. The last element is assumed to be a volume name and if no such volume is found, its assumed to be a stream name. Then the stream name is searched in all the volumes specified.

Its generally impossible to keep all the evidence you will ever need on the drive of your analysis system, and even if you get a vary large SAN its challanging to keep everything handy.</p> <p>By allowing evidence to be managed by HTTP its possible to distribute the evidence around any number of HTTP servers, which can be deployed at any location throughout the corporate WAN. This allows very cheap storage to be used and the flexibility to move images around the network at will.</p> <p>Similarly, current technologies for remote imaging are complex and proprietary. In a corporate LAN environment, for example, its beneficial to push the image directly to an imaging server from the target machine booted from a boot CD for example. Its nice to be able to do so with no prior preparation.</p> <p>Since AFF4 uses URNs to describes all objects in the AFF4 universe, and a URL is just a special kind of URN, it is possible to describe everything in terms of URLs too. For example, its possible to specify certificates, keys, and other file names as a URL as well (which means they can reside on a HTTP server). For example, its possible to encrypt the private key and place it on a HTTP server to allow an investigator to sign an acquisition from anywhere on the network without having to manage their own keys and certificates.</p> <p>Similarly its possible for investigators to create the image directly on the HTTP server using webdav. This section will discuss how to do this with an Apache2 server, but clearly since webdav is a standard its possible to use any other webserver too.</p> <p>Note: Windows XP webdav support is widely known to be very buggy.

It is based partially on CarvFs and the AnyCast-relay from the Open Computer Forensics Architecture. MattockFS uses CarvPath annotations to designate frozen repository data in the same way that CarvFs does. MattockFS was designed to address some of the shortcomings of OCFA in respect to disk-cache misses and access control, and as such aims to become an essential foundational component in future actor-model based computer forensic frameworks. MattockFS is not a complete computer forensics framework, rather MattockFS provides essential features that a computer forensics framework may build upon.</p> <p>MattockFS provides the following facilities to future actor-model based computer forensic frameworks:</p> <ul> <li>Lab-side privilege-separation equivalent of Sealed Digital Evidence   Bags. After creation,   repository data is made immutable, thus guarding the integrity of the   data from unintended write access by untrusted modules.</li> <li>Trusted provenance logs. Actors/workers roles in the processing of   digital evidence chunks are logged to a provenance log, leaving no   opportunity for untrusted modules to falsify or corrupt provenance   logs.</li> <li>CarvPath based access to frozen (immutable) data. Multi-layer   CarvPath based access in the same way as provided by   CarvFs.</li> <li>Domain specific actors oriented localhost message bus. MattockFS   provides sparse-capability based access to an Anycast message bus   aimed specifically at use by a computer forensics framework and the   concept of toolchains. This is basically the same functionality that   used to be provided by the Anycast-Relay in the Open Computer   Forensics   Architecture.</li> <li>CarvPath based opportunistic hashing. MattockFS maps all low-level   reads and writes to reads and writes on all active (either open files   or or part of an active tool-chain) CarvPaths and will   opportunisticaly calculate BLAKE2 hashes for these CarvPaths when   possible.</li> <li>Page-cache friendly archive interaction. MattockFS keeps track of   CarvPaths belonging to tool-chains that are not yet completely done.   It will communicate with the kernel when a toolchain completes and as   a result part of the archive should be considered to be no longer   active (and thus can be flushed from page cache).</li> <li>Actor Job picking policies: MattockFS implements multiple job   CarvPath based picking policies aimed either at opportunistic hashing   or page-cache load optimized strategies.</li> <li>Load balancing support: MattockFS allows a special actor, a   load-balancer, to steal jobs from other (overloaded) actors in order   to redistribute the job to an other node in a multi-host setup.</li> <li>Throttle information: MattockFS provides the overlaying computer   forensic framework with meta-data concerning potential page-cache load   and per Actor queue size and volume. Based on this information, actors   should throttle their new-data output in order to avoid spurious   page-cache misses caused by to much active evidence data at a time.</li> <li>Hooks for a distributed FIVES router. In the Open Computer   Forensics   Architecture a   stateless router process was responsible for dynamic toolchain-path   routing based on meta-data extracted from the evidence data. Later,   the FIVES project created an alternative router   process. This router carried state regarding the current location   within a routing rule-list over to the next time the same data was   processed by a router process. MattockFS provides a simple hook for   use by an envisioned distributed version of FIVES-router like   functionality.</li> </ul> <p>MattockFS is not a complete forensic framework, it is a component that can be used as foundation for a complete forensic framework. Currently MattockFS is in beta. MattockFS comes with a Python API aimed at usage by an overlaying computer forensics framework. Future API's for other programming languages (C++ and others) are planned.</p>","tags":["No Category"]},{"location":"mattockfs/#external-links","title":"External Links","text":"<ul> <li>Github page</li> <li>YouTube Presentation</li> </ul>","tags":["No Category"]},{"location":"mbox/","title":"Mbox","text":"<p>MBOX is a generic name to the family of related files that holds a collection of email messages in a single file.

This becomes a little more complicated when performing a live analysis of a machine since each command that is run to investigate the machine can affect memory, registers, and even the disk. In order to save the output of forensic tools and commands without writing to the disk of the victim machine, a tool such as Netcat can be used. Netcat is a small utility that allows output and even files to be immediately transferred from one machine to another over the network, rather than first having to save to the source machine's disk. This allows files and output to be saved and hashed on your forensic workstation for future use as evidence and to provide validation for your findings.</p> <p>Although small, Netcat is very powerful and simple to use. It also comes installed by default on many UNIX-like operating systems and can also be used on Windows systems. For use on systems that don't already contain Netcat, it's recommended to use the Netcat binaries that come with the free Nmap utility.</p> <p>It is important to note that because running Netcat creates on open listening port on your machine, the use of Netcat can present a significant security risk if used improperly. Be sure not to leave Netcat running when not in use, and avoid using switches (such as -e) that allow commands received by Netcat to be run on your machine. See here for a list of Netcat switches.</p>","tags":["Network Forensics","Tools"]},{"location":"netcat/#usage-instructions","title":"Usage Instructions","text":"<p>NOTE: When running Netcat on a UNIX-like operating system, the conventional name of the binary is nc. When running Netcat on a Windows-like operating system using the version that comes with nmap (see above), the default name of the binary is ncat. The instructions below use the nc name--make sure to replace it with ncat or whatever else your Netcat binary is named, if it is different.</p> <p>To use Netcat, you first need to set it up on your forensic workstation to listen for incoming information. This can be accomplished by running the following command in the terminal or command line:</p> <p><code>nc -v -l -p 2222 &gt;</code><code>.txt</code> <p>The \"-v\" tells Netcat to be verbose, meaning that it will print out more details about what is going on. The \"-l\" tells Netcat to listen for connections. The \"-p\" tells Netcat which port to listen for connections on (it's best to use a port above 1024, in order to avoid conflicting with \"well-known\" ports that may already be in use by your system). The \"&gt;\" tells the shell to redirect any of the information that Netcat receives to the specified file (we usually give it the name of the command that we are about to run on the victim machine (e.g., date.txt)). The file will be saved to the current working directory of the shell you are running Netcat in.</p> <p>Next, on the victim machine, run a command such as the following in the terminal or command line:</p> <p><code></code><code>| nc</code><code>2222</code> <p>Replace \"\" with whatever command you are running on the victim machine (e,g., \"date\", \"ifconfig\", etc.). Replace \"\" with the IP address of your forensic workstation (this can be identified by running the \"ifconfig\" command on UNIX-like systems and the \"ipconfig\" on Windows systems). The \"|\" tells the shell to \"pipe\" the standard output from the command as input to Netcat. Netcat will then send this information to the IP address and port specified (NOTE: by default only the \"standard output\" stream will be piped to Netcat. If you need the \"standard error\" stream piped to Netcat as well (see here for a refresher on the differences between streams), add the following text just after your command: 2&gt;&amp;1). Make sure you replace \"2222\" with whatever port you specified for Netcat to use on your forensic workstation above. <p>If the command is taking longer to run that it should, try pressing the \"CTRL\" and \"C\" keys simultaneously on the forensic workstation to force-stop Netcat from listening.</p> <p>Back on the forensic workstation, we can see that the listening Netcat received a connection from our victim machine (in this example we used the same machine to fill the role of forensic workstation and victim machine, which is why the \"from\" name and IP address match our forensic workstation). Then we used the \"cat\" command to view the contents of the date.txt file that was created by Netcat, which contained the output from the \"date\" command that we ran on the victim machine.</p> <p>When using Netcat to transfer file contents and binary files to your forensic workstation, commands such as the following can instead be used on your victim machine:</p> <p><code></code><code>type</code><code>| nc</code><code>2222</code> <p><code></code><code>cat</code><code>| nc</code><code>2222</code>","tags":["Network Forensics","Tools"]},{"location":"netcat/#video-demonstration","title":"Video Demonstration","text":"<p>The following YouTube video provides a brief tutorial on how to use Netcat to transfer data from a victim machine to a forensic machine:</p> <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcSS34Lw910</p>","tags":["Network Forensics","Tools"]},{"location":"netcat/#other-resources","title":"Other Resources","text":"<p>Netcat can also be used to capture network traffic.

Many systems also allow you to specify a switch to view not only the PID of the programs connected to those ports, but also their names. Because many hacking attacks attempt to create backdoors on the victim machine in order to establish another means of connecting back into the machine later, being able to view open ports and the programs attached to them can be very beneficial. Netstat can help you quickly identify any suspicious network behavior on the machine and help point you in the right direction to files and connections that may require additional investigation.</p> <p>Another great benefit to using the Netstat command is that it is one of the few commands that uses, for the most part, the same syntax on UNIX-like and Windows operating systems.

The -n parameter tells netstat to show all the TCP connections but to not resolve the host-name, this will greatly increase the speed of the command.

NetworkMiner can also perform OS fingerprinting based on DHCP packets (which usually are broadcast packets) by making use of the Satori (by Eric Kollmann) OS fingerprinting database from FingerBank. NetworkMiner also uses the MAC-vendor list from Nmap (by Fyodor).</p> <p>NetworkMiner can extract files and certificates transferred over the network by parsing a PCAP file or by sniffing traffic directly from the network. This is a neat function that can be used to extract and save media files (such as audio or video files) which are streamed across a network. Supported protocols for file extraction are FTP, HTTP and SMB.</p> <p>User credentials (usernames and passwords) for supported protocols are extracted by NetworkMiner and displayed under the \"Credentials\" tab. Please be considerate when displaying the contents of this tab to the public.</p> <p>Another very useful feature is that the user can search sniffed or stored data for keywords. NetworkMiner allows the user to insert arbitrary string or byte-patterns that shall be searched for with the keyword search functionality.</p> <p>Version 0.84 (and newer) of NetworkMiner support sniffing and parsing of WLAN (IEEE 802.11) traffic. NetworkMiner does however currently only support WiFi sniffing with AirPcap adapters.</p> <p>There is also a commercial version available of NetworkMiner from Netresec.

The basic OcfaLib API allows for the fast and simple creation of simple dissector and extractor modules for OCFA, but has some limitations. To overcome these limitations, the 2.2 version of OCFA re-vectored and promoted an API that was previously used internally by th OCFA library to an API available to module builders. The OCFA treegraph API defines an interface that a loadable library must implement in order to be usable as an advanced dissector module bu the Open Computer Forensics Architecture. Basically it defines an interface 'TreeGraphNode' that a treegraph module will need to derive one or many classes from. A TreeGraphNode can contain data, meta-data and sub node's that are also TreeGraphNode implementations. The data interface of the TreeGraphNode also allows treegraph modules that are CarvFs aware, to return a carvpath as so called soft linkable path'. Doing so allows OCFA to use substantially less storage resources.</p> <p>An example of a treegraph module for OCFA is included in the 2.2 release of OCFA. This example is the OCFA mmls module. The ocfa mmls module reproduces the functionality of the The Sleuth Kit mmls tool.

The C++ class ocfa::module::OcfaModule defines the base class of what all OCFA modules are derived. Depending on the type of module, the ocfa::facade namespace provides different convenient subclasses. The OcfaModule class defines a virtual function named ProcessEvidence that the final module class must implement. A typical module implementation implements a subclass by implementing a constructor and a ProcessEvidence method. The main function of the module program will create an instance of the module class and call the run method on the object. The module will connect and register itself to the OCFA Anycast Relay and thus be connected into the Open Computer Forensics Architecture. For each piece of evidence data the module receives, the ProcessEvidence method will get invoked. The implementation of the ProcessEvidence method can depending on the type of facade used as baseclass can:</p> <ul> <li>Gain read access to the input evidence data.</li> <li>Use its own private workdir for derived and temporary data</li> <li>Derive evidence from the input evidence.</li> <li>Access meta data created by other modules.</li> <li>Add additional metadata to the input evidence or child evidences.</li> </ul> <p>For a simple example of a module that derives data from data look at the tar module in OcfaModules/dissector/tar.

The main goal is to automate the digital forensic process to speed up the investigation and give tactical investigators direct access to the seized data through an easy to use search and browse interface.</p> <p>The architecture forms an environment where existing forensic tools and libraries can be easily plugged into the architecture and can thus be made part of the recursive extraction of data and metadata from digital evidence.</p> <p>The Open Computer Forensics Architecture aims to be highly modular, robust, fault tolerant, recursive and scalable in order to be usable in large investigations that spawn numerous terabytes of evidence data and covers hundreds of evidence items.</p> <p>Modules in OCFA for reasons of fault tolerance are processes. The basic OcfaLib API makes it possible and relatively easy to build an OCFA module out of any data processing library or tool. OCFA comes with numerous such modules that are mostly wrappers around libraries like libmagic or tools such as those found in the The Sleuth Kit.</p> <p>The 2.2 version of OCFA (released April 2009) makes the previously internal OCFA treegraph API available for OCFA module development. The OCFA treegraph API allows more advanced dissectors that produce data and meta-data for a treegraph representation of an input file. The OCFA treegraph API also allows dissectors that are programed to be CarvFs aware to use zero storage carving.</p> <p>Communication between modules within OCFA is governed by a two layered communication infrastructure as provided by OCFA. At the lowest layer is a messaging system with at is center the OCFA AnyCast-relay. The Anycast Relay provides the facilities of module crash resistance, distributed processing load balancing and flow control. At a higher level of communication, the OCFA XML Router provides for the routing of individual pieces of evidence through the most appropriate tool chain for its particular type of content.</p> <p>Although OCFA contains a rudimentary user interface, most of its power is in the backend architecture. The last and final module in the tool chain of any evidence will be the OCFA Data Store Module. This module processes the evidence XML (that contains all of the evidence data its meta data) and stores relevant parts into a postgesql database. Extending the apache based user interface with interfaces for your own case bound queries is something that should proof very useful in most investigations.</p> <p>Development and maintenance of OCFA by the Dutch National Police has been discontinued in 2012.

This not only holds true for cases of cybercrime, but also for traditional delicts such as murder or blackmail, and also private corporate investigations rely on digital forensics. This leads to an increasing number of cases with an ever-growing amount of data, that exceeds the capacity of the forensic experts. To support investigators to work more efficiently, we introduce a novel approach to automatically reconstruct events that previously occurred on the examined system and to provide a quick overview to the investigator as a starting point for further investigation. In contrast to the few existing approaches, our solution does not rely on any previously profiled system behavior or knowledge about specific applications, log files, or file formats. We further present a prototype implementation of our so-called zero knowledge event reconstruction approach, that solely tries to make sense of characteristic structures in file system metadata such as file- and folder-names and timestamps.</p> <p>May 2014  @inproceedings{Hurley:2013:MAC:2488388.2488444, <p><code>author\u00a0=\u00a0{Hurley,\u00a0Ryan\u00a0and\u00a0Prusty,\u00a0Swagatika\u00a0and\u00a0Soroush,\u00a0Hamed\u00a0and\u00a0Walls,\u00a0Robert\u00a0J.\u00a0and\u00a0Albrecht,\u00a0Jeannie\u00a0and\u00a0Cecchet,\u00a0Emmanuel\u00a0and\u00a0Levine,\u00a0Brian\u00a0Neil\u00a0and\u00a0Liberatore,\u00a0Marc\u00a0and\u00a0Lynn,\u00a0Brian\u00a0and\u00a0Wolak,\u00a0Janis},</code> <code>title\u00a0=\u00a0{Measurement\u00a0and\u00a0Analysis\u00a0of\u00a0Child\u00a0Pornography\u00a0Trafficking\u00a0on\u00a0P2P\u00a0Networks},</code> <code>booktitle\u00a0=\u00a0{Proceedings\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a022Nd\u00a0International\u00a0Conference\u00a0on\u00a0World\u00a0Wide\u00a0Web},</code> <code>series\u00a0=\u00a0{WWW\u00a0'13},</code> <code>year\u00a0=\u00a0{2013},</code> <code>isbn\u00a0=\u00a0{978-1-4503-2035-1},</code> <code>location\u00a0=\u00a0{Rio\u00a0de\u00a0Janeiro,\u00a0Brazil},</code> <code>pages\u00a0=\u00a0{631--642},</code> <code>numpages\u00a0=\u00a0{12},</code> <code>url\u00a0=\u00a0{http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2488388.2488444)},</code> <code>acmid\u00a0=\u00a0{2488444},</code> <code>publisher\u00a0=\u00a0{International\u00a0World\u00a0Wide\u00a0Web\u00a0Conferences\u00a0Steering\u00a0Committee},</code> <code>address\u00a0=\u00a0{Republic\u00a0and\u00a0Canton\u00a0of\u00a0Geneva,\u00a0Switzerland},</code> <code>keywords\u00a0=\u00a0{digital\u00a0forensics,\u00a0forensic\u00a0triage},</code></p> <p>}  Peer-to-peer networks are the most popular mechanism for the criminal acquisition and distribution of child pornography (CP). In this paper, we examine observations of peers sharing known CP on the eMule and Gnutella networks, which were collected by law enforcement using forensic tools that we developed. We characterize a year's worth of network activity and evaluate different strategies for prioritizing investigators' limited resources. The highest impact research in criminal forensics works within, and is evaluated under, the constraints and goals of investigations. We follow that principle, rather than presenting a set of isolated, exploratory characterizations of users.</p> <p>First, we focus on strategies for reducing the number of CP files available on the network by removing a minimal number of peers. We present a metric for peer removal that is more effective than simply selecting peers with the largest libraries or the most days online. Second, we characterize six aggressive peer subgroups, including: peers using Tor, peers that bridge multiple p2p networks, and the top 10% of peers contributing to file availability. We find that these subgroups are more active in their trafficking, having more known CP and more uptime, than the average peer. Finally, while in theory Tor presents a challenge to investigators, we observe that in practice offenders use Tor inconsistently. Over 90% of regular Tor users send traffic from a non-Tor IP at least once after first using Tor.</p> <p>June 2013  @INPROCEEDINGS{6503202, author={Gessiou, E. and Volanis, S. and Athanasopoulos, E. and Markatos, E.P. and Ioannidis, S.}, booktitle={Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), 2012 IEEE}, title={Digging up social structures from documents on the web}, year={2012}, pages={744-750}, abstract={We collected more than ten million Microsoft Office documents from public websites, analyzed the metadata stored in each document and extracted information related to social activities.

We show that it is possible to match authors collaborating in the creation of a document with Twitter accounts. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to identify individuals and create social cliques solely based on information derived from document metadata. Our study raises major concerns about the risks involved in privacy leakage due to document metadata.</p> <p>Jan 2013  @article{young:distinct, <p><code>title=\"Distinct\u00a0Sector\u00a0hashing\u00a0for\u00a0Target\u00a0Detection\",</code> <code>author=\"Joel\u00a0Young\u00a0and\u00a0Kristina\u00a0Foster\u00a0and\u00a0Simson\u00a0Garfinkel\u00a0and\u00a0Kevin\u00a0Fairbanks\",</code> <code>year=2012,</code> <code>month=Dec,</code> <code>journal=\"IEEE\u00a0Computer\"</code></p> <p>}  Using an alternative approach to traditional file hashing, digital forensic investigators can hash individually sampled subject drives on sector boundaries and then check these hashes against a prebuilt database, making it possible to process raw media without reference to the underlying file system.</p> <p>Aug 2012  @misc{apple, title=\"In\ufb01ltrate the Vault: Security Analysis and Decryption of Lion Full Disk Encryption\", <p><code>abstract=\"With\u00a0the\u00a0launch\u00a0of\u00a0Mac\u00a0OS\u00a0X\u00a010.7\u00a0(Lion),\u00a0Apple\u00a0has\u00a0introduced\u00a0a\u00a0volume\u00a0encryption\u00a0mechanism\u00a0known\u00a0as\u00a0FileVault\u00a02.\u00a0Apple\u00a0only\u00a0disclosed\u00a0marketing\u00a0aspects\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0closed-source\u00a0software,\u00a0e.g.\u00a0its\u00a0use\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0AES-XTS\u00a0tweakable\u00a0encryption,\u00a0but\u00a0a\u00a0publicly\u00a0available\u00a0security\u00a0evaluation\u00a0and\u00a0detailed\u00a0description\u00a0was\u00a0unavailable\u00a0until\u00a0now..\u00a0We\u00a0have\u00a0performed\u00a0an\u00a0extensive\u00a0analysis\u00a0of\u00a0FileVault\u00a02\u00a0and\u00a0we\u00a0have\u00a0been\u00a0able\u00a0to\u00a0\ufb01nd\u00a0all\u00a0the\u00a0algorithms\u00a0and\u00a0parameters\u00a0needed\u00a0to\u00a0successfully\u00a0read\u00a0an\u00a0encrypted\u00a0volume.\u00a0This\u00a0allows\u00a0us\u00a0to\u00a0perform\u00a0forensic\u00a0investigations\u00a0on\u00a0encrypted\u00a0volumes\u00a0using\u00a0our\u00a0own\u00a0tools.\u00a0In\u00a0this\u00a0paper\u00a0we\u00a0present\u00a0the\u00a0architecture\u00a0of\u00a0FileVault\u00a02,\u00a0giving\u00a0details\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0key\u00a0derivation,\u00a0encryption\u00a0process\u00a0and\u00a0metadata\u00a0structures\u00a0needed\u00a0to\u00a0perform\u00a0the\u00a0volume\u00a0\u00a0decryption.\u00a0Besides\u00a0the\u00a0analysis\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0system,\u00a0we\u00a0have\u00a0also\u00a0built\u00a0a\u00a0library\u00a0that\u00a0can\u00a0mount\u00a0a\u00a0volume\u00a0encrypted\u00a0with\u00a0FileVault\u00a02.\u00a0As\u00a0a\u00a0contribution\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0research\u00a0and\u00a0forensic\u00a0communities\u00a0we\u00a0have\u00a0made\u00a0this\u00a0library\u00a0open\u00a0source.\u00a0Additionally,\u00a0we\u00a0present\u00a0an\u00a0informal\u00a0security\u00a0evaluation\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0system\u00a0and\u00a0comment\u00a0on\u00a0some\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0design\u00a0and\u00a0implementation\u00a0features.\u00a0Among\u00a0others\u00a0we\u00a0analyze\u00a0the\u00a0random\u00a0number\u00a0generator\u00a0used\u00a0to\u00a0create\u00a0the\u00a0recovery\u00a0password.\u00a0We\u00a0have\u00a0also\u00a0analyzed\u00a0the\u00a0entropy\u00a0of\u00a0each\u00a0512-byte\u00a0block\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0encrypted\u00a0volume\u00a0and\u00a0discovered\u00a0that\u00a0part\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0user\u00a0data\u00a0was\u00a0left\u00a0unencrypted\",</code></p> <p>author=\"Omar Choudary and Felix Grobert and Joachim Metz\", year=2012, month=Aug, url=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/374.pdf\" }  With the launch of Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), Apple has introduced a volume encryption mechanism known as FileVault 2. Apple only disclosed marketing aspects of the closed-source software, e.g. its use of the AES-XTS tweakable encryption, but a publicly available security evaluation and detailed description was unavailable until now.. We have performed an extensive analysis of FileVault 2 and we have been able to \ufb01nd all the algorithms and parameters needed to successfully read an encrypted volume. This allows us to perform forensic investigations on encrypted volumes using our own tools. In this paper we present the architecture of FileVault 2, giving details of the key derivation, encryption process and metadata structures needed to perform the volume decryption. Besides the analysis of the system, we have also built a library that can mount a volume encrypted with FileVault 2. As a contribution to the research and forensic communities we have made this library open source. Additionally, we present an informal security evaluation of the system and comment on some of the design and implementation features. Among others we analyze the random number generator used to create the recovery password. We have also analyzed the entropy of each 512-byte block in the encrypted volume and discovered that part of the user data was left unencrypted.</p> <p>Mar 2012</p> <p> @inproceedings{Walls:2011a, Author = { Robert J.

Similarly, when forensic research is evaluated using the viewpoints held by computer security venues, the challenges, constraints, and usefulness of the work is often misjudged. In this paper, we point out many key aspects of digital forensics with the goal of ensuring that research seeking to advance the discipline will have the highest possible adoption rate by practitioners. We enumerate general legal and practical constraints placed on forensic investigators that set the \ufb01eld apart. We point out the assumptions, often limited or incorrect, made about forensics in past work, and discuss how these assumptions limit the impact of contributions.</p> <ul> <li>Usenix Presentation</li> <li>Slides</li> <li>paper</li> </ul> <p>March 2012  @inproceedings{Balasubramaniyan:2010:PUS:1866307.1866320, <p><code>author\u00a0=\u00a0{Balasubramaniyan,\u00a0Vijay\u00a0A.\u00a0and\u00a0Poonawalla,\u00a0Aamir\u00a0and\u00a0Ahamad,\u00a0Mustaque\u00a0and\u00a0Hunter,\u00a0Michael\u00a0T.\u00a0and\u00a0Traynor,\u00a0Patrick},</code> <code>title\u00a0=\u00a0{PinDr0p:\u00a0using\u00a0single-ended\u00a0audio\u00a0features\u00a0to\u00a0determine\u00a0call\u00a0provenance},</code> <code>booktitle\u00a0=\u00a0{Proceedings\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a017th\u00a0ACM\u00a0conference\u00a0on\u00a0Computer\u00a0and\u00a0communications\u00a0security},</code> <code>series\u00a0=\u00a0{CCS\u00a0'10},</code> <code>year\u00a0=\u00a0{2010},</code> <code>isbn\u00a0=\u00a0{978-1-4503-0245-6},</code> <code>location\u00a0=\u00a0{Chicago,\u00a0Illinois,\u00a0USA},</code> <code>pages\u00a0=\u00a0{109--120},</code> <code>numpages\u00a0=\u00a0{12},</code> <code>url\u00a0=\u00a0{</code><code>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1866307.1866320</code><code>},</code> <code>doi\u00a0=\u00a0{</code><code>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1866307.1866320</code><code>},</code> <code>acmid\u00a0=\u00a0{1866320},</code> <code>publisher\u00a0=\u00a0{ACM},</code> <code>address\u00a0=\u00a0{New\u00a0York,\u00a0NY,\u00a0USA},</code> <code>keywords\u00a0=\u00a0{VoIP,\u00a0call\u00a0fingerprinting,\u00a0provenance,\u00a0telephony},</code></p> <p>}</p> <p> The recent diversification of telephony infrastructure allows users to communicate through landlines, mobile phones and VoIP phones.

In this paper, we develop PinDr0p, a mechanism to assist users in determining call provenance \u2014 the source and the path taken by a call. Our techniques detect and mea- sure single-ended audio features to identify all of the applied voice codecs, calculate packet loss and noise profiles, while remaining agnostic to characteristics of the speaker\u2019s voice (as this may le- gitimately change when interacting with a large organization). In the absence of verifiable call metadata, these features in combina- tion with machine learning allow us to determine the traversal of a call through as many as three different providers (e.g., cellular, then VoIP, then PSTN and all combinations and subsets thereof) with 91.6% accuracy. Moreover, we show that once we identify and characterize the networks traversed, we can create detailed fin- gerprints for a call source. Using these fingerprints we show that we are able to distinguish between calls made using specific PSTN, cellular, Vonage, Skype and other hard and soft phones from loca- tions across the world with over 90% accuracy. In so doing, we provide a first step in accurately determining the provenance of a call.</p> <p>Jan 2012</p> <p> @article{10.1109/CIS.2011.180, author = {Vrizlynn L.L.

Such information is useful for many forensic purposes including establishment of prior connection activity and services used; identification of other systems present on the system's LAN or WLAN; geolocation of the host computer system; and cross-drive analysis. We show that network structures can also be recovered from memory that is persisted onto a mass storage medium during the course of system swapping or hibernation. We present our network carving techniques, algorithms and tools, and validate these against both purpose-built memory images and a readily available forensic corpora.

It is currently proposed or in use for a wide variety of purposes, including targeted marketing, restricting digital content sales to authorized jurisdictions, and security applications such as reducing credit card fraud. This raises questions about the veracity of claims of accurate and reliable geolocation. We provide a survey of Internet geolocation technologies with an emphasis on adversarial contexts; that is, we consider how this technology performs against a knowledgeable adversary whose goal is to evade geolocation. We do so by examining first the limitations of existing techniques, and then, from this base, determining how best to evade existing geolocation techniques. We also consider two further geolocation techniques which may be of use even against adversarial targets: (1) the extraction of client IP addresses using functionality introduced in the 1.5 Java API, and (2) the collection of round-trip times using HTTP refreshes. These techniques illustrate that the seemingly straightforward technique of evading geolocation by relaying traffic through a proxy server (or network of proxy servers) is not as straightforward as many end-users might expect. We give a demonstration of this for users of the popular Tor anonymizing network.</p> <p>FEB-2010 The 'CSI Effect': Does It Really Exist?, by The Honorable Donald E. Shelton</p> <p>Crime and courtroom proceedings have long been fodder for film and television scriptwriters. In recent years, however, the media's use of the courtroom as a vehicle for drama has not only proliferated, it has changed focus. In apparent fascination with our criminal justice process, many of today's courtroom dramas are based on actual cases. Court TV offers live gavel-to-gavel coverage of trials over the Internet for \\$5.95 a month. Now, that's \"reality television\"!</p> <p>Reality and fiction have begun to blur with crime magazine television shows such as 48 Hours Mystery, American Justice, and even, on occasion, Dateline NBC. These programs portray actual cases, but only after extensively editing the content and incorporating narration for dramatic effect. Presenting one 35-year-old cold case, for example, 48 Hours Mystery filmed for months to capture all pretrial hearings as well as the 2-week trial; the program, however, was ultimately edited to a 1-hour episode that suggested the crime remained a \"mystery\" . . . notwithstanding the jury's guilty verdict....</p> <p>JAN-2010 Using Graphics Processors for Parallelizing Hash-based Data Carving, by Sylvain Collange, Marc Daumas, Yoginder S. Dandass, and David Defour, Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009.</p> <p>Abstract</p> <p>The ability to detect fragments of deleted image files and to reconstruct these image files from all available fragments on disk is a key activity in the field of digital forensics. Although reconstruction of image files from the file fragments on disk can be accomplished by simply comparing the content of sectors on disk with the content of known files, this brute-force approach can be time consuming.</p> <p>This paper presents results from research into the use of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) in detecting specific image file byte patterns in disk clusters. Unique identifying pattern for each disk sector is compared against patterns in known images. A pattern match indicates the potential presence of an image and flags the disk sector for further in-depth examination to confirm the match.

Gubian, P. Jungheum Park Seok Hee Lee Sangjin Lee</p> <p>Korea Univ., Seoul, International Conference on Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering, 2008. MUE 2008/</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>Nowadays compressed files are very widespread and can be considered, without any doubt, with regard to the Digital Forensic realm, an important and precious source of probatory data. This is especially true when in a digital investigation the examiner has to deal with corrupted compressed files, which have been gathered in the collection phase of the investigative process. Therefore, in the computer forensic field, data recovery technologies are very important for acquiring useful pieces of data which can become, in a court of low, digital evidence. This kind of technology is used not only by law enforcement, but also by the multitude of users in their daily activities, which justify the relevant presence of tools in the software market which are devoted to rescue data from damaged compressed files. However, state-of-the-art data recovery tools have many limitations with regard to the capability of recovering the original data, especially in the case of damaged compressed files. So far, such recovery tools have been based on a which controls the signature/header of the file and, thus, provides the offset to the raw compressed data block. As a result, they cannot recover the compressed files if the first part of the raw compressed data block, which pertains to the header, is damaged or the signature/header block is corrupted. Therefore, in order to deal with this issue, we have developed a new tool capable of rescuing damaged compressed files, according to the DEFLATE compression scheme, even though the header block is missing or corrupted. This represents a new interesting opportunity for the digital forensic discipline.</p> <p>2009-May</p> <p>Overcoming Impediments to Cell Phone Forensics, by Wayne Jansen, Aurelien Delaitre, and Ludovic Moenner, Proceedings of the 41st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2008</p> <p>Cell phones are an emerging but rapidly growing area of computer forensics. While cell phones are becoming more like desktop computers functionally, their organization and operation are quite different in certain areas. For example, most cell phones do not contain a hard drive and rely instead on flash memory for persistent storage. Cell phones are also designed more as special purpose appliances that perform a set of predefined tasks using proprietary embedded software, rather than general-purpose extensible systems that run common operating system software. Such differences make the application of classical computer forensic techniques difficult. Also complicating the situation is the state of the art of present day cell phone forensic tools themselves and the way in which tools are applied. This paper identifies factors that impede cell phone forensics and describes techniques to address two resulting problems in particular: the limited coverage of available phone models by forensic tools, and the inadequate means for validating the correct functioning of forensic tools</p> <p>2009-Apr</p> <p>A Framework for Automated Digital Forensic Reporting, by Lt. Paul Farrell, Master's Thesis, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA, March 2009 Forensic analysis is the science of finding, examining and analyzing evidence in support of law enforcement, regulatory compliance or information gathering. Today, almost all digital forensic analysis is done by humans, requiring dedicated training and consuming man-hours at a considerable rate. As storage sizes increase and digital forensics gain importance in investigations, the backlog of media requiring human analysis has increased as well. This thesis tests today's top-of-the-line commercial and open source forensic tools with the analysis of a purpose-built Windows XP computer system containing two users that engaged in email, chat and web browsing. It presents the results of a pilot user study of the PyFlag forensic tool. Finally, it presents a technique to use software to do a preliminary analysis on media and provide a human readable report to the examiner. The goal of the technique is to perform rapid triaging of media and allow the human examiner to better prioritize man hours towards media with high return on investment.</p> <p>2009-Feb-08</p> <p>The impact of full disk encryption on digital forensics, ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review archive, Volume 42, Issue 3 (April 2008), Pages 93-98 The integration of strong encryption into operating systems is creating challenges for forensic examiners, potentially preventing us from recovering any digital evidence from a computer. Because strong encryption cannot be circumvented without a key or passphrase, forensic examiners may not be able to access data after a computer is shut down, and must decide whether to perform a live forensic acquisition. In addition, with encryption becoming integrated into the operating system, in some cases, virtualization is the most effective approach to performing a forensic examination of a system with FDE. This paper presents the evolution of full disk encryption (FDE) and its impact on digital forensics. Furthermore, by demonstrating how full disk encryption has been dealt with in past investigations, this paper provides forensics examiners with practical techniques for recovering evidence that would otherwise be inaccessible.</p> <p>2009-JAN-01</p> <p>Forensic Investigation of the Nintendo Wii: A First Glance, by Dr. Benjamin Turnbull, SMALL SCALE DIGITAL DEVICE FORENSICS JOURNAL, VOL. 2, NO. 1, JUNE 2008 ISSN# 1941-6164 The closed nature of the Wii makes it a challenging game console for forensic analysis.

David Nadeau's thesis presents a novel approach which bootstraps a named entity recognizer using semi-structured documents on the web. Few forensic tools use NER today, but that may well change in the future. What makes this thesis so interesting to read is that it also has a history of the last 20 years or so of the field.

In this paper the authors show that cryptographic keys in memory are vulnerable to exploitation after the computer is turned off. The authors show that the contents of dynamic RAM are retained seconds, and sometimes minutes, after power is turned off. By chilling the memory the data can be retained as long as necessary. And while most laptops wipe their memory when they reboot, the authors show that the chilled memory can be moved from one laptop that wipes to another laptop that does not wipe. Finally, the authors show that it is possible to find the cryptographic keys in memory and correct random bit errors by using the AES key schedule as an error-correction code. The authors demonstrate an attack USB stick which reboots a computer protected with BitLocker, finds the cryptographic keys, and then allows access to the cleartext information on the disk.</p> <p>2008-July-27</p> <p>The Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (2008) concluded this past week in Pittsburgh, PA.

The fragmentation point is identi\ufb01ed when SHT identi\ufb01es a block as not belonging to the \ufb01le.

The bifragment gap carving technique enhanced with SHT allows us to improve the performance result of DFRWS 2006 challenge test-sets, although the technique cannot be used for DFRWS 2007. We then show how Parallel Unique Path enhanced with SHT is able to recover all fragmented JPEGs from DFRWS 2006 and all recoverable JPEGs from 2007 challenge test-sets. As far as we are aware, no other automated technique can recover multi-fragmented JPEGs from the DFRWS 2007 test set.\"</p> <p>2008-July-5</p> <p> @article{ <p><code>publisher=\"Taylor\u00a0&amp;\u00a0Francis\",</code> <code>journal=\"Journal\u00a0of\u00a0Digital\u00a0Forensic\u00a0Practice\",</code> <code>author=\"Yoginder\u00a0Singh\u00a0Dandass\u00a0and\u00a0Nathan\u00a0Joseph\u00a0Necaise\u00a0and\u00a0Sherry\u00a0Reede\u00a0Thomas\",</code> <code>title=\"An\u00a0Empirical\u00a0Analysis\u00a0of\u00a0Disk\u00a0Sector\u00a0Hashes\u00a0for\u00a0Data\u00a0Carving\",</code> <code>year=2008,</code> <code>volume=2,</code> <code>issue=2,</code> <code>pages=\"95--106\",</code> <code>abstract=\"Discovering\u00a0known\u00a0illicit\u00a0material\u00a0on\u00a0digital\u00a0storage\u00a0devices\u00a0is\u00a0an\u00a0important\u00a0component\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0digital\u00a0forensic\u00a0investigation.\u00a0Using\u00a0existing\u00a0data\u00a0carving\u00a0techniques\u00a0and\u00a0tools,\u00a0it\u00a0is\u00a0typically\u00a0difficult\u00a0to\u00a0recover\u00a0remaining\u00a0fragments\u00a0of\u00a0deleted\u00a0illicit\u00a0files\u00a0whose\u00a0file\u00a0system\u00a0metadata\u00a0and\u00a0file\u00a0headers\u00a0have\u00a0been\u00a0overwritten\u00a0by\u00a0newer\u00a0files.\u00a0In\u00a0such\u00a0cases,\u00a0a\u00a0sector-based\u00a0scan\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0used\u00a0to\u00a0locate\u00a0those\u00a0sectors\u00a0whose\u00a0content\u00a0matches\u00a0those\u00a0of\u00a0sectors\u00a0from\u00a0known\u00a0illicit\u00a0files.\u00a0However,\u00a0brute-force\u00a0sector-by-sector\u00a0comparison\u00a0is\u00a0prohibitive\u00a0in\u00a0terms\u00a0of\u00a0time\u00a0required.\u00a0Techniques\u00a0that\u00a0compute\u00a0and\u00a0compare\u00a0hash-based\u00a0signatures\u00a0of\u00a0sectors\u00a0in\u00a0order\u00a0to\u00a0filter\u00a0out\u00a0those\u00a0sectors\u00a0that\u00a0do\u00a0not\u00a0produce\u00a0the\u00a0same\u00a0signatures\u00a0as\u00a0sectors\u00a0from\u00a0known\u00a0illicit\u00a0files\u00a0are\u00a0required\u00a0for\u00a0accelerating\u00a0the\u00a0process.</code></p> <p>This article reports the results of a case study in which the hashes for over 528 million sectors extracted from over 433,000 files of different types were analyzed. The hashes were computed using SHA1, MD5, CRC64, and CRC32 algorithms and hash collisions of sectors from JPEG and WAV files to other sectors were recorded. The analysis of the results shows that although MD5 and SHA1 produce no false-positive indications, the occurrence of false positives is relatively low for CRC32 and especially CRC64. Furthermore, the CRC-based algorithms produce considerably smaller hashes than SHA1 and MD5, thereby requiring smaller storage capacities. CRC64 provides a good compromise between number of collisions and storage capacity required for practical implementations of sector-scanning forensic tools.\",</p> <p><code>url=\"</code><code>https://taylorandfrancis.com</code><code>\"</code></p> <p>} </p> <p>Authors Dandass et. al analyzed 528 million sectors from 433,630 unique files. They computed the CRC32, CRC64, MD5 and SHA-1 of each sector. Not surprisingly, they find that the MD5 and SHA-1s of the sectors are different if the sectors are different. They find 94 CRC64 collisions and 30 million CRC32 collisions. The conclusion is that, if you are search for a single sector or building a database of single sector hashes, you are better off building a database of CRC64s because they are easier to store and dramatically faster to calculate than the traditional hash functions, and they are nearly as accurate.</p>","tags":["No Category"]},{"location":"paul_ohm/","title":"Paul ohm","text":"<p>' Paul Ohm' is a professor at the University of Colorado Law School.

When this offline data is archived in Outlook application, messages are archived and stored as PST file.</p> <p>PST file utilizes a fixed-block-based scheme for allocating memory. The file is enlarged by pre-defined sum of bytes and file preserves the information internally regarding allocated and non-allocated blocks. So when email messages are added to PST file, file size is adjusted accordingly by Outlook application. When any message is removed or deleted, file size remains unchanged marking space as unallocated where future items will be saved.

Released in May of 2004 in Japan and March 2005 in the US, the PSP includes has quickly become the most popular next-generation portable gaming device in the states slightly edging the Nintendo DS. In Japan, on the other hand, the DS is outselling the PSP by almost 3.5 to 1 (Japanese Sales Charts, 2006).</p> <p>The PSP features a 4.3\" widescreen LCD with a 480x272 pixel resolution. Behind that screen is a dual-core 222MHz R4000 CPU. The CPU has been successfully overclocked to 333MHz, but Sony does not allow developers to deploy their games at that speed. The PSP also has 32MB of RAM and 4MB of embedded DRAM where the OS is contained (Wikipedia, 2006). The device has a lithium-ion battery for power and a claimed battery life of three to six hours of game play. Finally, the PSP has a USB interface for transferring data to and from the system's Memory Stick Pro Duo. Software is available for both the Mac and Windows platform to ease the transfer of multimedia files to the device. One such application is PSPWare for Mac OS X.</p> <p>The PSP has an updatable firmware using the Wi-Fi interface found on the device. The device connects to Sony's servers and downloads the update to a Memory Stick Pro Duo. With each new firmware release, Sony has fixed bugs in the device as well as adding new features. In a recent release, Sony added a Web browser and RSS reader so users can browse the web using their PSP. Though somewhat awkward to use, the browser does support history and bookmarks, which can be extracted using an application like PSPWare (Jefte.net, 2006). Currently, the firmware is at version 2.60.</p> <p>Besides playing games and UMD-based movies, the PSP can also play MP3, AAC WMA, WAV and ATRAC3 audio files. It does not play AAC files downloaded from the iTunes Music Store because Apple does not license their Fairplay DRM technology. The device can also view MPEG-4 videos and many of the standard image file formats. Video files stored on the PSP's Memory Stick, they are located in the /MP_ROOT/100MNV01/ directory and named with the following format: M4V#####.MP4 (where \"#\" is any number) (Wikipedia, 2006).</p> <p>Hardware hackers have taken to modifying the software of the PSP to run \u00d2homebrew\" applications. With the first version of the Sony PSP firmware, it was found that the device could execute unsigned code. This homebrew revolution has been lead by gamers desire to emulate games from older video game systems such as the Nintendo and Super Nintendo (Gizmodo, 2005). Others have used their PSP as television remote and many developers are trying to get Linux to run on the PSP. Just last week, ucLinux was successfully ran on the PSP, though it doesn't do much more than load the Linux kernel (PSPHacks.net, 2006).</p> <p>With each firmware revision, Sony tries to block the homebrew community from modifying the PSP's software. With the latest version 2.60 update of the firmware, it was thought that Sony had finally solved the problem, but a bug in Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories allowed for unsigned code to be executed once more much to Sony's chagrin (Wikipedia, 2006).</p> <p>Forensics involving the PSP will be a growing market as more and more people acquire the devices. The PSP is the first mobile video gaming device that allows for more than just playing games. Now criminals can surf the Web, store pornography and store incriminating information on their video game system. There does not seem to be any set of best practices for acquiring data from the PSP, nor any application like Paraben's PDA Seizure to automatically acquire the data. Unlike the T-Mobile Sidekick device, however, the PSP's USB port allows for the upload and download of data from the device.</p>","tags":["Articles that need to be expanded"]},{"location":"pst_file_viewer/","title":"Pst file viewer","text":"<p>Free PST Viewer Free PST Viewer is a freeware application to open, read and view PST files without the help of MS Outlook.

Cell phones, which are designed to increase power in the case of low levels of interference, react to this interference. Consequently, jamming devices must be aware of any increases in power by the cellular device and match that power level accordingly.</p> <p>As cellular telephones are full-duplex devices utilizing two separate frequencies (one for talking, one for listening, where all parties to a call can talk at the same time as opposed to half-duplex walkie-talkies and CBs), any removal of one of these frequencies tricks the phone into thinking there is no cellular service. Consequently, the jammer need only block one of the frequencies.</p> <p>The less complex jammers can only block a specific frequency group while the more complex jammers can block several different networks thus preventing dual- or tri-mode phones from switching to a different network with an open signal. Jammers are able to broadcast on any frequency and can interrupt AMPS, CDMA, TDMA, GSM, PCS, DCS, iDEN and Nextel systems. The effective range of a jammer is dependent upon the strength of its power source and the immediate pysical environment (hills or walls which may block the jamming signal). Lower powered jammers have a call-block range of about 30 feet while higher power units can create a cellular signal-free zone about the size of a football field. In addition, certain units applied by law enforcement have been known to shut down cellular service approximately 1 mile from the jamming device.</p>","tags":["No Category"]},{"location":"radio_frequency_%28rf%29_jammers/#whats-inside-a-cell-phone-jammer","title":"What's Inside a Cell Phone Jammer","text":"<p>RF jammers are fairly simplistic devices.

It is responsible for boosting the power as necessary to jam signals.</p> <p>Power Supply -- Smaller jamming devices may use batteries while larger and more power-intensive devices can be plugged into a standard outlet or connected through the electrical system of a vehicle.</p>","tags":["No Category"]},{"location":"radio_frequency_%28rf%29_jammers/#in-which-legal-situations-are-rf-jammers-used","title":"In Which Legal Situations are RF Jammers Used?","text":"<p>Originally developed for law enforcement and military, RF jammers have been mainly used to disrupt the communications of criminals and terrorists. One of the most useful applications has been to use RF jammers to prevent the use of cell-phone activated bombs in subways, airports, and the routes of presidential motorcades. Furthermore, in hostage situations, police can use RF jammers to place controls on when and where the criminal can make a call. In drug raids, jammers can be used to prevent outside communication. Finally, corporations have also been known to use RF jammers to prevent corporate espionage by blocking voice and image transmissions from camera-enabled phones.</p>","tags":["No Category"]},{"location":"radio_frequency_%28rf%29_jammers/#legal-issues-of-using-rf-jammers","title":"Legal Issues of Using RF Jammers","text":"<p>The United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and many other countries have determined that cell-phone blocking is illegal.

Simply put, jamming that frequency is seen as stealing the private property of that company. Secondly, RF jamming is seen as a safety hazard as it could potentially block important and urgent phone calls, such as calls for police or an ambulance.</p> <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) enforces the jamming laws but has yet to actually prosecute anyone.

During that time, the processing capability of the computers has increased enormously. At the same time the storage capacity of the computers has increased from tens of Megabytes to hundreds of Gigabytes and the use of Terabyte storage devices in both commercial and private locations is now becoming increasingly common. In recent years, because of social change and alterations in the way in which organisations work, there has also been an increasing trend in the use of the same computer to process and store both the organisation\u2019s and the individuals personal information. It is clear that the majority of organisations and private individuals still remain ignorant or misinformed of the potential volume and type of information that is stored on the hard disks contained within these computer systems. As a result, they have not considered, or are unaware of, the potential impact of this information becoming available to an unintended third party.</p> <p>This is the fourth study in an ongoing research effort that is being conducted into the volume and type of information that remains on computer hard disks offered for sale on the second hand market. The research has been undertaken to gain an understanding of the level and types of information that remains on these disks and to determine the damage that could, potentially be caused, if the information was misused. These studies have examined a large number of disks that have been purchased in a number of countries. The rationale for this was to determine whether there are any national or regional differences in the way that computer disks are disposed of and to compare the results for any regional or temporal trends.</p> <p>The first study was carried out in 2005 and has been repeated annually with the scope extended to include additional research partners and countries during each of the subsequent years. The studies were carried out by British Telecommunications and the University of Glamorgan in the UK, Edith Cowan University in Australia and Longwood University in the USA.</p> <p>The core methodology of the research has remained the same over the duration of the study: to acquire a number of second hand computer disks from a range of sources and then to determine whether they still contained information relating to a previous owner or if the device had been effectively erased. If the disks still contained information, the research examined whether it was in a sufficient volume and of enough sensitivity to the original owner to represent a risk if unintentionally exposed to a third party. One of the results of the research has been that for a very large proportion of the disks that have been examined, there was significant information present and both organisations and individuals were potentially exposed to the possibility of a compromise of sensitive information. Potential impacts of this might include embarrassment to individuals and organisations, fraud, blackmail and identity theft. It is noted that where the disks had originally been owned by organisations, they had, in most cases, failed to meet their statutory, regulatory and legal obligations.</p> <p>In the 2008 study, the fourth in the series, the research methodology that had been followed in the previous studies was repeated, but in addition the scope was again broadened geographically to include disks sourced from within France.</p> <p>},</p> <p><code>issn\u00a0=\u00a0{1901-8401},</code></p> <p>} </p>","tags":["No Category"]},{"location":"residual_data_on_used_equipment/#see-also","title":"See Also","text":"<ul> <li>Residual Data</li> <li>Residual Data in Document Files</li> <li>Privacy Rights Clearinghouse Chronology of Data Breaches</li> </ul>","tags":["No Category"]},{"location":"resilient_file_system_%28refs%29/","title":"Resilient file system (refs)","text":"<p>The Resilient File System (ReFS) (AKA protogon) was introduced in Windows 8, with the intention of eventually replacing NTFS.

It typically applies to a technology that uses radio waves to automatically identify people or objects. While there are various ways to identify, the most common is to store a serial number that represents a person or object identity and possibly other information, on a microchip that is attached to an antenna. Collectively the microchip and antenna represent a RFID transponder or an RFID tag. The antenna gives the chip ability to transmit identity information to a RFID reader. Then the RFID reader converts the radio waves into digital information that can then be passed to the computer for usage. RFID has been around since the 1970s. Since the radio waves from the low end of the electromagnetic spectrum, waves are safe as radio waves from a car radio.</p> <p>RFID and Bar codes are different technologies and have different applications. The big difference between the two is bar codes are line-of-sight technology. A scanner requires a bar code be brought towards a scanner in order for it to be read. RFID on the other hand, doesn\u2019t require line of sight. RFID tags can be read as long as they are within range of a RFID reader. If a label is somehow removed or damaged there is no way to scan the item.</p> <p>Currently many forms and sizes such as personal items, services, and products use RFID worldwide. Currently in the United States, most public transportation such as trains, buses, and restaurants such as Mcdonald's all carry RFID receptacles that allow credit card transactions using MasterCard's PayPass. MasterCard PayPass is the payment feature that can be added to any MasterCard payment account to enable payments with a simple tap. PayPass is flexible enough that it can be built into cards or other devices such as key fobs, and can be used in markets that primarily issue smart cards or those that primarily issue magnetic stripe cards.</p> <p>InfoSync reported that, Motorola and MasterCard are conducting field tests of new mobile phones that include Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chips embedded in them as part of a cashless payment system dubbed PayPass. The phones will be equipped with Near Field Communication (NFC) systems, which will allow them to communicate with nearby readers to, for instance, pay for small purchases or tickets for transit or events simply by passing their phone close to a reader.</p> <p>Once the phone and account has been identified by the RFID tag, the user's MasterCard account will be billed automatically by the network for the appropriate amount. MasterCard also sees potential for the phones as contactless readers, which it claims opens the door for \"a variety of marketing a 1000 nd promotional applications\", on which the company did not elaborate further.</p> <p>The PayPass trials will be run by the end of the 2006 at various locations in the United States.</p>","tags":["No Category"]},{"location":"rich_text_format_%28rtf%29/","title":"Rich text format (rtf)","text":"<p>The Rich Text Format (RTF) is a format for text and graphics interchange.

The original R&amp;D was sponsored by the US Air Force Reseach Lab (AFRL). During a Phase I STTR contract in 2007, Pikewerks founder Sandy Ring implemented Linux kernel integrity checks and cross-view analysis in a framework she called \"Scouts\". Under a subsequent Phase II STTR contract that ran from 2008 to 2009, Andrew Tappert and Tom O'Connor developed the software for Linux kernel integrity verification via memory forensics, codenamed \"pH\", that would become Second Look.</p> <p>Second Look publicly debuted at the DoD Cyber Crime Conference in St. Louis in January 2009. The first supported distributions were CentOS and Ubuntu (32-bit only). Subsequent internally-funded R&amp;D at Pikewerks led to the first hosted reference kernel repository, supporting automated Linux memory forensics, and 64-bit support. Product releases and backend infrastructure work in 2010 expanded the set of supported kernel versions and distros to include CentOS, Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), and Ubuntu.</p> <p>In 2011, commercial sales of the product picked up, and it was used to investigate some high profile compromises involving Linux server infrastructure. In December 2011, Pikewerks was acquired by Raytheon, joining its IIS business unit. The year 2012 saw development of the pagehash-based process integrity verification technique, expanding the scope of memory forensics-based verification beyond the kernel. In 2012 the Enterprise edition of Second Look was launched, which performed automated Linux memory forensics scans at scale (the original mode of operation was ad hoc acquisition and analysis during investigations). Debian was added as a supported distribution. In 2014, Second Look gained structured data output (JSON format) and more supported distributions (Amazon Linux and Oracle Linux). Also in 2014, the product and its development team joined Raytheon's Cyber Products group. In 2015, Raytheon Cyber Products was spun out into a joint venture with Websense, and the product was marketed as SureView Memory Integrity. The product got a web interface in 2015, replacing the legacy Qt-based GUI, and new capabilities for automatically extracting artifacts from memory. In 2016, the Raytheon-Websense joint venture was named Forcepoint, and the product was called Threat Protection for Linux. The scope of memory integrity verification was further expanded in 2016 with the addition of cached file verification features, and an advanced alert filtering framework was added. As of 2017, the product is known as Forcepoint Linux Security, and is deployed around the world to enhance the security of large-scale Linux-based IT infrastructure.</p>","tags":["Linux","Memory Analysis","Tools"]},{"location":"second_look/#capabilities","title":"Capabilities","text":"<p>Second Look provides memory acquisition capabilities (local and remote), which preserve the volatile system state, capturing evidence and information that does not exist on disk and may otherwise be lost as an investigation proceeds.

How do examiners know the evidence is not being changed when \"forensic\" tools are used to extract the data from a cell phone.</p> <p>A step in the right direction is to monitor the data being transferred in between the phone and the forensic workstation. Most of the devices make use of a USB cord to transfer the data. It would be advised to monitor that port to see what commands the workstation is asking the cell phone to execute. A serial port monitor would be able to independently monitor the data transferred.</p> <p>Cell phone manufacturers use different command languages to communicate with the cell phone. Three of the most common types of commands are AT Commaands, Obex, and Jtag.

SQL Server records the changes in memory every now and then and writes it to the transaction log file. Thus the changes are recorded to transaction log file first and then to database which is also known as write-ahead log. Hence, this SQL transaction log file is a critical element of database and as it holds all the records it can be employed to recover database back to consistent state in case of system failure.

It is a widely-known program that offers a myriad of options to gather exactly the information that you want from the network. The output of Tcpdump can also be formatted as a PCAP file, which can then be opened and investigated using many different packet analyzing tools, including Wireshark. Tcpdump also comes installed by default on many UNIX-like system distributions. If not installed, binaries can be downloaded using apt-get (or an equivalent) or compiled using the source code from here.</p> <p>Below you will find some of the Tcpdump switches most useful in typical digital forensic investigations, including the ability to transfer Tcpdump output in binary form (which creates a PCAP file) to a forensic workstation using Netcat. See here for a complete list of Tcpdump switches, along with other information on the Tcpdump manpage.</p> <p>In order to transfer the output of Tcpdump on the victim machine to a PCAP file on your forensic workstation using Netcat, you will first need to set Netcat up to listen on your forensic workstation using the following command (see here for a refresher on using Netcat for digital forensic investigations (note that here we use the extension \".pcap\" instead of \".txt\" because we are creating a binary PCAP file, rather than just text ouptut)):</p> <p><code>nc -v -l -p 2222 &gt;</code><code>.pcap</code> <p>Next, run a command similar to the following one on your victim machine:</p> <p><code></code><code>tcpdump -s 0 -U -n -i eth0 not host</code><code>-w - | nc</code><code>2222</code> <p>The \"-s 0\" tells Tcpdump to use the default snapshot-length bytes of data from each packet (65535 bytes) to ensure that packets aren't truncated. The \"-U', when used with \"-w\" tells Tcpdump to write the packet information to the output immediately, rather than waiting for the output buffer to fill. The \"-n\" tells Tcpdump to use the IP addresses in the packets, rather than trying to resolve them into host names using DNS. The \"-i eth0\" tells Tcpdump to listen for all packets on the \"eth0\" interface (information about different interfaces can be located using the \"ifconfig\" command; using \"-i any\" instead will tell Tcpdump to listen on all interfaces). The \"not host \" is the filter syntax for Tcpdump, and tells it not to gather packets involving the specified host IP address--in this case, our forensic workstation. This is very important when using Tcpdump with Netcat because otherwise Tcpdump would get stuck in an endless loop of sending the same packet data as output through Netcat since each transmission from Netcat would then immediately be recaptured by Tcpdump and sent to Netcat again and again until either the program crashes or we run out of disk space on a forensic workstation. There are also many other filters you can use with Tcpdump (see the manpage link above). The \"-w\" tells Tcpdump to redirect the output to a file, but since we have included a \"-\" after it (\"-w -\"), Tcpdump knows to output the binary data so that we can pipe it to whatever we want (in this case, Netcat). This allows the data to be sent to our forensic workstation in a full PCAP file so that we can perform various analyses on it.","tags":["Network Forensics"]},{"location":"tcpdump/#video-demonstration","title":"Video Demonstration","text":"<p>The following YouTube video provides a tutorial on how to conduct a basic packet capture with tcpdump: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AFjQv5jhyM</p>","tags":["Network Forensics"]},{"location":"tcpdump/#external-links","title":"External Links","text":"<ul> <li>Project page</li> <li>WinDump - tcpdump for Windows</li> </ul>","tags":["Network Forensics"]},{"location":"tcpflow/","title":"Tcpflow","text":"<p>tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient for protocol analysis and debugging.

This module can also be compiled for other Linux distributions with minor effort (see, for example, http://gleeda.blogspot.com/2009/08/devcrash-driver.html). When the crash driver is modified, compiled, and loaded on other systems, the resulting memory access device is not safe to image in its entirety. Care must be taken to avoid addresses that are not RAM-backed. On Linux, /proc/iomem exposes the correct address ranges to image, marked with \"System RAM\".</p> <p>/dev/mem On older Linux systems, the program dd can be used to read the contents of physical memory from the device file /dev/mem. On recent Linux systems, however, /dev/mem provides access only to a restricted range of addresses, rather than the full physical memory of a system. On other systems it may not be available at all. Throughout the 2.6 series of the Linux kernel, the trend was to reduce direct access to memory via pseudo-device files.

Tygar, University of California, Berkeley Paul Van Oorschot, Carleton University</p> <p>OVERVIEW Information security involves both technology and people. To design and deploy secure systems, we require an understanding of how users of those systems perceive, understand, and act on security risks and threats.</p> <p>This one-day workshop will bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers, systems designers, and developers to discuss how the fields of human computer interaction, applied psychology, and computer security can be brought together to inform innovations in secure systems design. We seek to deepen the conversation about usable security to go beyond the user interface, toward developing useful and usable systems of humans and technology.</p> <p>TOPICS Topics include but are not limited to:</p> <p>- Error detection and recovery - Human perception and cognitive information processing - Identity and impression management - Individual and cultural differences - Information seeking and evaluation - Judgment and decision-making - Learning, training, and experience - Mental models - Models of privacy, sharing, and trust - Organizational, group, and individual behavior - Risk perception, risk analysis, and risk communication - Security behavior study methodology - Social engineering - Social influence and persuasion - System proposals and design approaches - Threat evaluation - Usability - User motivation and incentives for secure behavior</p> <p>The study of human attention, learning, reasoning, and behavior addresses issues of central relevance to computer security. For example:</p> <p>- Security weaknesses often arise from biases in human perception and cognitive information processing. For example, phishing attacks use confusing perceptual cues and fear to trick users into revealing sensitive information.</p> <p>- Assessing, creating, and managing secure systems requires ongoing information seeking and information evaluation, as new threats emerge constantly. However, understanding complex and dynamic systems is time-consuming and error-prone, and users have little motivation to spend the time and effort that is required.</p> <p>- The perception of risk can influence users' willingness to employ security mechanisms or engage in risky behavior. However, risk perception and decision-making are often based on limited domain knowledge and are subject to bias; we underestimate some risks and exaggerate others.</p> <p>- People's level of confidence in their risk assessments can be perceptually and socially manipulated, independent of actual risks. Attackers (and system designers) often create the perception of security, even when none exists.</p> <p>- Human reasoning follows certain patterns, which are subject to change with experience. Through training and education, we can help users to learn methods and procedures and develop mental models of how security systems work.</p> <p>- People learn through interaction with others. Models of social influence suggest that information garnered from a trusted source can affect people's behavior or attitudes, but the level of trust conferred on others is dependent on situational factors. Organizational factors and group behavior can also have a large effect on individual behavior.</p> <p>- Approaches to risk assessment, identity and impression management, and trust vary from one individual to another and also vary by culture.</p> <p>SUBMISSIONS Usability, Psychology, and Security 2008 invites insightful new contributions that apply aspects of human/computer interaction and applied psychology to solving problems in computer security. We invite submissions in two categories.</p> <p>1. Short papers: We encourage short papers that describe innovative work in progress or position papers that map out directions for future research or design. Short papers should be no longer than five (5) pages.</p> <p>2. Full papers: Full papers may describe systems, case studies, fieldwork descriptions, experimental studies, and design frameworks. Full papers must be no longer than ten (10) single-spaced 8.5\" x 11\" pages, including figures, tables, and references.</p> <p>All submissions should offer new contributions that have not been published elsewhere. Author names and affiliations should appear on the title page. Submissions must be in PDF and must be submitted via the form on the Usability, Psychology, and Security 2008 Call for Papers website:</p> <p>https://www.usenix.org/legacy/upsec08/cfp/</p> <p>Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication in the Proceedings.</p> <p>Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, and plagiarism constitute dishonesty or fraud. USENIX, like other scientific and technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may, on the recommendation of a program chair, take action against authors who have committed them. In some cases, program committees may share information about submitted papers with other conference chairs and journal editors to ensure the integrity of papers under consideration. If a violation of these principles is found, sanctions may include, but are not limited to, barring the authors from submitting to or participating in USENIX conferences for a set period, contacting the authors' institutions, and publicizing the details of the case.</p> <p>Note, however, that we expect that many papers accepted for the workshop will eventually be extended as full papers suitable for presentation at future conferences.</p> <p>Authors uncertain whether their submission meets USENIX's guidelines should contact the Program Chairs, upsec08chairs@usenix.org, or the USENIX office, submissionspolicy@usenix.org.</p> <p>HISTORY This workshop evolved from Usable Security (USEC'07).

Log entries are made human-readable at analysis time through tools such as the event viewer, by combining pre-defined log templates (stored in system DLLs and EXEs) with variable data stored in the EVT file. The templates and variable data are combined with a call to FormatMessage(), which means the templates look similar to printf()'s format strings.</p> <p>When event viewer (or other log viewing tools) displays log records, it has to determine which DLLs store the message templates. This linking information is stored in the registry, and is specific to each type of log (System, Security, Application, etc). These entries ultimately point out a list of DLLs which contain the message templates. Each log record contains a relative virtual address (RVA) to reference the associated message template. The lower 16 bits of this RVA is typically displayed as the Message ID, but this alone generally isn't enough to uniquely reference a message template.</p> <p>All of this means that EVT files aren't really complete on their own. The files which store the core meaning of the log entry are separate from the logs themselves and this creates several analysis problems. First of all, an attacker could modify DLLs or the registry in order to change the meaning of logs without having to touch the EVT file at all. Secondly, when software is uninstalled in the future, it could cause some EVT records to lose their context. Finally, EVT files aren't particularly portable to other systems, since some log records could rely on message templates which don't exist on other systems.

Although this method could reveal interesting details about the memory image, there was no way to associate what data came from what program, let alone what user.</p> <p>In the summer 2005 the Digital Forensic Research Workshop published a Memory Analysis Challenge. They distributed two memory images and asked researchers to answer a number of questions about a security incident. The challenge produced two seminal works. The first, by Chris Betz, introduced a tool called memparser. The second, by George Garner and Robert-Jan Mora produced KnTList.</p> <p>At the Blackhat Federal conference in March 2007, AAron Walters and Nick Petroni released a suite called Volatools. Although it only worked on Windows XP Service Pack 2 images, it was able to produce a number of useful data. Volatools was updated and re-released as Volatility in August 2007, and is now maintained and distributed by Volatile Systems.</p>","tags":["Bibliographies"]},{"location":"windows_memory_analysis/#bibliography","title":"Bibliography","text":"<p>2012</p> <ul> <li>Defeating Windows memory forensics,   by Luka Milkovic, 29C3: 29th Chaos Communication Congress</li> </ul> <p>2011</p> <ul> <li>Tracking Stuxnet's Footprint Through Memory,   by Michael Ligh, Open Memory Forensics Workshop</li> </ul> <p>2010</p> <ul> <li>Extracting Windows Command Line Details from Physical Memory,   by Richard Stevens and Eoghan Casey, DFRWS</li> </ul> <p>2009</p> <ul> <li>Robust Signatures for Kernel Data Structures   by B.

In Windows 8 the shadow volumes seem to have been superseded by File History. For now it looks like it uses similar structures as its predecessors.</p> <p>Windows Shadow Copy is a service that either manually or automatically creates backup copies of disk volumes. These backups are automatically created when Windows performs either a scheduled backup or a system restore point. This happens before Windows Updates are installed, or when Windows determines that it is time to create a new system restore point, which is determined by both system idle time and the time since a previous system restore point was created. In Windows Vista, this is one day. On Windows 7 and newer, this is seven days. Windows XP creates them every 24 hours regardless of system activity.</p> <p>Shadow copies are initially created as block-level clones of entire drives.

Because Shadow Copies clone on a block-level rather than a file-level, changes to individual files may not be enough to cause Windows to make the changes in a corresponding Shadow Copy.</p> <p>Additionally, depending on the user\u2019s individual settings, the Shadow Copy service might be turned off, resulting in no Shadow Copies being stored. Other times, the disk space settings might be set too low for multiple Shadow Copies to be saved, or even for one Shadow Copy to be saved if it is larger than what the settings allow. Windows automatically overwrites Shadow Copies when the disk space limit is reached.

Several Wi-Fi network security technologies have been developed to combat hackers, of course, although some of these technologies can be defeated more easily than others.</p> <p>Network Data Encryption Network security protocols usually use encryption technology. Encryption scrambles data sent over network connections to hide information from humans while still allowing computers to properly decipher the messages. Many forms of encryption technology exist in the industry.</p> <p>Network Authentication Authentication technology for computer networks verifies the identity of devices and people. Network operating systems like Microsoft Windows and Apple OS-X include built-in authentication support based on user names and passwords. Home network routers also authenticate administrators by requiring them to enter separate login credentials.</p> <p>Ad Hoc Wi-Fi Network Security Traditional Wi-Fi network connections go through a router or other wireless access point. Alternatively, Wi-Fi supports a mode called ad hoc wireless that allows devices to connect directly to each other in peer to peer fashion. Lacking a central connection point, the security of ad hoc Wi-Fi connections tends to be low. Some experts discourage the use of ad-hoc Wi-Fi networking for this reason.</p> <p>Common Wi-Fi Security Standards Most Wi-Fi devices including computers, routers and phones support several security standards. The available security types and even their names vary depending on a device's capabilities.</p> <p>WEP stands for Wired Equivalent Privacy. It is the original wireless security standard for Wi-Fi and is still commonly used on home computer networks.

This standard was developed to replace WEP. Wi-Fi devices typically support multiple variations of WPA technology. Traditional WPA, also known as WPA-Personal and sometimes also called WPA-PSK (for pre-shared key), is designed for home networking while another version, WPA-Enterprise, is designed for corporate networks. WPA2 is an improved version of Wi-Fi Protected Access supported by all newer Wi-Fi equipment. Like WPA, WPA2 also exists in Personal/PSK and Enterprise forms.</p> <p>802.1X provides network authentication to both Wi-Fi and other types of networks. It tends to be used by larger businesses as this technology requires additional expertise to set up and maintain. 802.1X works with both Wi-Fi and other types of networks. In a Wi-Fi configuration, administrators normally configure 802.1X authentication to work together with WPA/WPA2-Enterprise encryption. 802.1X is also known as RADIUS.</p> <p>Network Security Keys and Pass-phrases WEP and WPA/WPA2 utilize encryption keys, long sequences of hexadecimal numbers. Matching key values must be entered into a Wi-Fi router (or access point) and all client devices wanting to join that network. In network security, the term passphrase can refer to a simplified form of encryption key that only uses alphanumeric characters instead of hexadecimal values. However, the terms passphrase and key are often used interchangeably.</p> <p>Configuring Wi-Fi Security on Home Networks All devices on a given Wi-Fi network must use matching security settings. On Windows 7 PCs, the following values must be entered on the Security tab of Wireless Network Properties for a given network:</p> <ul> <li>Security type refers to authentication options including Open, Shared,   WPA-Personal and \u2013Enterprise, WPA2-Personal and \u2013Enterprise, and   802.1X. The Open option utilizes no authentication, while Shared   utilizes WEP for authentication.</li> <li>Encryption type options available depend on the Security type chosen.   Besides None, which can be only used with Open networks, the WEP   option can be used with either WEP or 802.1X authentication. Two other   options, called TKIP and AES, refer to specialized encryption   technologies usable with the WPA family of Wi-Fi security standards.</li> <li>An encryption key or passphrase can be specified in the Network   security key field when required.</li> <li>The Key Index, a value between 1 and 4, refers to the position of the   matching key stored on the wireless router (access point). Many home   routers allow four different encryption keys numbered 1 through 4 to   be configured in order to support legitimate clients without forcing   them to all use a common key.</li> </ul>","tags":["Articles that need to be expanded"]},{"location":"wireshark/","title":"Wireshark","text":"<p>Wireshark is a popular network protocol analyzer.</p>","tags":["Network Forensics","Open Source Software","Windows","Linux","Windows","Solaris","NetBSD","FreeBSD","MacOS","OpenBSD"]},{"location":"wireshark/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Wireshark has a rich feature set which includes the following:</p> <ul> <li>Deep inspection of hundreds of protocols;</li> <li>Live capture and offline analysis;</li> <li>Standard three-pane packet browser;</li> <li>Multi-platform: runs on Windows,   Linux, Mac OS X,   Solaris, FreeBSD,   NetBSD, and many others;</li> <li>Captured network data can be browsed via a GUI, or via the TTY-mode   TShark utility;</li> <li>Powerful display filters;</li> <li>Rich VoIP analysis;</li> <li>Read/write many different capture file formats: tcpdump (libpcap),   Catapult DCT2000, Cisco Secure IDS iplog, Microsoft Network   Monitor, Network General   Sniffer\u00ae (compressed and uncompressed), Sniffer\u00ae Pro, and NetXray\u00ae,   Network Instruments Observer, Novell LANalyzer, RADCOM WAN/LAN   Analyzer, Shomiti/Finisar Surveyor, Tektronix K12xx, Visual Networks   Visual UpTime, WildPackets EtherPeek/TokenPeek/AiroPeek, and many   others;</li> <li>Capture files compressed with gzip can be decompressed on the fly;</li> <li>Live data can be read from Ethernet,   IEEE 802.11, PPP/HDLC, ATM, Bluetooth,   USB, Token Ring, Frame Relay, FDDI, and others (depending on your   platfrom);</li> <li>Decryption support for many protocols, including   IPsec, ISAKMP, Kerberos, SNMPv3,   SSL/TLS, WEP, and   WPA/WPA2;</li> <li>Coloring rules can be applied to the packet list for quick, intuitive   analysis;</li> <li>Output can be exported to XML, PostScript\u00ae,   CSV, or plain text.</li> </ul>","tags":["Network Forensics","Open Source Software","Windows","Linux","Windows","Solaris","NetBSD","FreeBSD","MacOS","OpenBSD"]},{"location":"wireshark/#network-forensics","title":"Network Forensics","text":"<p>Wireshark can be used in the network forensics process.
