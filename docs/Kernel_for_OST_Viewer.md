Kernel OST Viewer is a free OST viewing utility available for Windows
users. The freeware is developed by Kernel Data Recovery to perform
quick examination on damaged/healthy Outlook offline storage files (OST)
and make them readable without using MS Outlook environment. The viewer
can open and read the containing items of the file, like e-mails,
attachments, tasks, appointment, notes, etc. within the software
interface.

Kernel OST Viewer was launched on September 3, 2010 and since then it is
open for free use. It is one of the many useful utilities offered in
Kernel free tools for unrestricted download and lifetime use.

# Overview

Kernel for OST Viewer is a standalone utility to scan and view
healthy/corrupt OST files without worrying about the intensity of the
corruption. The tool has an advanced feature to intact default
properties of original file and maintain complete data integrity of file
items. The independently-programmed architecture of the utility enables
users to open OST files, regardless of the necessity to install MS
Outlook and Exchange Server platforms on the host machine.

# Interface

The OST Viewer has neat and self-descriptive Graphical User Interface,
to offer simplified and secured working environment for administrators
and users from non-technical backgrounds. The interface embeds an
instant search functionality to extend the overall speed and performance
of the process for locating the OST file. The search feature is handy at
times when the precise location of the file is unknown to the user. The
utility also features the option to open single file/multiple files at
once and display them in a single cycle to promote flexible working.

# Features

throwing any type of error, caused from different reasons like data
storage device failure, power failure, networking connection failure,
incorrect file system recovery, virus attacks, synchronization troubles
etc.

## View Password-Protected File

Kernel OST Viewer uses unique programming technology to open and view
encrypted OST files (password-protected) without necessarily having the

## View Deleted items & Attachments

The software facilitates a preview pane for the users to view the total
list of items contained in OST files. The recovered items are separated
in different folders depending upon the category of components like
inbox, deleted items, calendar, schedules, address book, tasks,
journals, etc.

The view of items is represented in a tree-like structure to maintain
simplified user readability. The deleted items are retrieved and marked
in red color to give quick and easy identification to the viewer. The
option to open email messages with attachments is also permitted to the
user within the tool.

## Customized View Settings

The OST file items can be viewed using any of the two preview tabs:
Simple View and Advanced Properties View. The Advanced Properties View

according to the end-user by arranging them on the basis of different
sorting fields like from, subject, date/time etc.

the available filters (like from, to, subject, received before/after,
