Steve Gibson is the President and Founder of Gibson Research
Corporation, CA, USA. From 1986 to 1993 he was a columnist and editor
for InfoWorld Magazine. In the past he has also held positions with
Hovik Corporation and as an Independent Consultant. Gibson Research's
most well known product is the disk recovery tool known as SpinRite.
