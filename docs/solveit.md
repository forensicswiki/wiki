**SOLVE-IT** (Systematic Objective-based Listing of Various Established 
(Digital) Investigation Techniques) is an open source knowledge base for 
and by the digital forensic community that describes and indexes techniques 
available to digital forensic investigators during an examination.

Uniquely, it also describes potential weakness at each stage of a digital 
forensic investigation, including in digital forensic tools. It also provides 
Python tooling to compile the contents of the knowledge base into different 
formats, making it useful for a number of different applications.

## Use
The many potential applications of SOLVE-IT include:

- strengthen tool testing by scoping error-focused data sets for a technique
- reinforce techniques by cataloguing available mitigations for weaknesses
- bolster quality assurance by identifying potential weaknesses in a specific processes
- structure consideration of potential uses of AI in digital forensics
- augment automation by highlighting relevant CASE ontology classes
- prioritize innovation by identifying academic research opportunities
- standardizing language and terminology in teaching using the indexed techniques
- conducting capability assessments of labs or individuals against the techniques

One of the most interesting and immediate applications of SOLVE-IT is to avoid 
missed or unmitigated errors in digital forensic processes. This can be 
undertaken to review either standard processes, tool workflows, or even 
individual investigations.
