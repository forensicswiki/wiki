**SOLVE-IT** (Systematic Objective-based Listing of Various Established 
(Digital) Investigation Techniques) is a knowledge base for 
and by the digital forensic community, supported by [DFRWS.org](digital_forensic_research_workshop.md), that describes and indexes techniques 
available to digital forensic investigators during an examination.

Uniquely, it also describes potential weakness at each stage of a digital 
forensic investigation, including in digital forensic tools. It also provides 
Python tooling to compile the contents of the knowledge base into different 
formats, making it useful for a number of different applications.

## Use
The many potential applications of SOLVE-IT include:

- strengthen tool testing by scoping error-focused data sets for a technique
- reinforce techniques by cataloguing available mitigations for weaknesses
- bolster quality assurance by identifying potential weaknesses in a specific processes
- structure consideration of potential uses of AI in digital forensics
- augment automation by highlighting relevant CASE ontology classes
- prioritize innovation by identifying academic research opportunities
- standardizing language and terminology in teaching using the indexed techniques
- conducting capability assessments of labs or individuals against the techniques

One of the most interesting and immediate applications of SOLVE-IT is to avoid 
missed or unmitigated errors in digital forensic processes. This can be 
undertaken to review either standard processes, tool workflows, or even 
individual investigations.
