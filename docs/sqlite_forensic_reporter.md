**SQLite Forensic Reporter** is a commercial
[analysis](analysis.md) tool. A universal SQLite database
examination tool capable of analysing, extracting and reporting on
information from any [SQLite database](sqlite_database.md) (not
corrupted or encrypted). Useful for Computer & Phone Forensic Analysts
and Data Recovery Technicians. Processes all SQLite database files in a
case, uses advanced file recognition and decoding not available in any
other tool.

This tool differs by firstly allowing the user to determine how a
database is identified and then secondly how data is decoded through
user created templates. Includes all the currently known date and time
formats and some custom formatting options making it one of the most
useful tools for examining SQLite databases to date.
