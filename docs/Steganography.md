**Steganography** is a science that pertains to the art of concealing
data in a communication in such a way that only the sender and receiver
know of its existance and method of access. The platform used for
transmission can be anything from a paper document to a digital file.
Additionally, it is more common than not to
[encrypt](encrypt "wikilink") the hidden data whenever possible such as
with digital files or images. The detection of steganographically
encoded packages is called **[steganalysis](steganalysis "wikilink")**.
