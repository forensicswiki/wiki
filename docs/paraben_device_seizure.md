Paraben's Device Seizure is a handheld forensics tool that provides
deleted data recovery, full data dumps of certain cell phone models,
logical and physical acquisitions of PDAs, data cable access, and
advanced reporting. The amount and quality of data you can get from a
full physical acquisition surpasses the information you can get from a
simple logical acquisition. Device Seizure does not change data on the
device.

Note: Accessing phones via IrDA and Bluetooth should only be used when
other data connections are not available due to the insecure nature of
these communication methods.
