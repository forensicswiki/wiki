**Solaris** is a highly scalable enterprise grade
[UNIX](unix.md) Operating System from [Sun
Microsystems](sun_microsystems.md). Solaris is known to run on
[SPARC](sparc.md) and x86/x86-64 architectures, although it has
also been ported to [PowerPC](powerpc.md) and IBM
[zSeries](zseries.md) [mainframes](mainframes "wikilink") in a
joint effort with [IBM](ibm.md).

Commonly used filesystems and / or volume managers on the Solaris
Operating System are [UFS](ufs.md), [ZFS](ZFS "wikilink"),
[SAMFS](samfs.md), [QFS](QFS "wikilink"), Veritas
[VxFS](vxfs.md) and Veritas [VxVM](VxVM "wikilink"),
[AVS](avs.md) as well as the Solaris Volume Manager
([solstice](solstice.md).
