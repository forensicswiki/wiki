OLM aka Outlook For Mac files are the proprietary file format of
Microsoft Outlook For Mac. Outlook for Mac as suggested by the name is
supported in Macintosh operating system and is analogous to MS Outlook
that is supported in Windows operating system. A single OLM file stores
the entire Mac Outlook data comprising of emails, contacts, calendars,
etc.

## Overview

Originally, OLM files came into existence with the introduction of
Microsoft Outlook 2011 for Mac in the year 2011. Although the OLM files
are the master repository for storing local data of Outlook for Mac but
it is not created by default. The OLM files can be generated via
different export methods. While exporting data to an OLM file, the
information can be filtered out depending on the type of data that is
required to reside in the file. In case there is a need to export only
Networking information to an OLM file, the items that have been assigned
to the Network category should be exported in the OLM file. To prevent
exceeding the maximum size limit, the emails in the Outlook for Mac can
be archived in an OLM file.

## Support

OLM files were first introduced with Microsoft. The maximum size of the
OLM files is not specified but in general the size should not exceed
above 2 GB. Exceeding the 2 GB size may lead to failure in exporting the
OLM file if needed.

No corroboration so far has been released for supporting Outlook Mac OLM
files in Windows or any other non-Macintosh machines. Although third
party implementations have successfully achieved this success in
accessing OLM files in Windows machine.
