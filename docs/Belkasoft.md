forensic solution. Belkasoft Evidence Center makes it easy for an
investigator to acquire, search, analyze, store and share digital
evidence found inside computer and mobile devices, RAM and cloud. The
toolkit will quickly extract digital evidence from multiple sources by
analyzing hard drives, drive images, cloud, memory dumps, iOS,
Blackberry and Android devices, GrayKey, UFED, OFB, ZIP/TAR, TWRP
images, JTAG, and chip-off dumps. Evidence Center X automatically
analyzes the data source and lays out the most forensically important
artifacts for an investigator to review, examine more closely or add to
a report.

incident response tool developed specifically for a quick analysis of a
live computer and making a partial image of important data. The product

**[Belkasoft Live RAM
Capturer](Belkasoft_Live_RAM_Capturer "wikilink")** is a tiny free

volatile memory - even if protected by an active anti-debugging or
anti-dumping system. Separate 32-bit and 64-bit builds are available in

captured with Belkasoft Live RAM Capturer can be analyzed with any
forensic tool including Live RAM Analysis in Belkasoft Evidence Center.

evidence collected with the main suite. Users of Evidence Reader can
access evidence collected during an investigation from any computer,

than 130 countries, including the FBI, US Army, DHS, police departments
