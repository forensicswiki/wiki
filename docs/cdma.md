**Code division multiple access** (**CDMA**) is a cellular frequency
that, originally developed during World War II for military purposes,
incorporates "spread spectrum" techniques. Unlike other cellular systems
like [GSM](gsm.md) and [TDMA](TDMA "wikilink"), every channel on
the network uses the full available spectrum. This allows each user
(identified by a unique [pseudonoise code](pseudonoise_code.md)
([pn](pn.md) to communicate over several frequencies, as
opposed to only one. CDMA is an improved version of TDMA (Time Division
Multiple Access). TDMA uses a time-sharing protocol to provide three to
four times more capacity than analog systems, just as a GSM.

## History

[Qualcomm](qualcomm.md) developed the key advances that made
CDMA suitable for [cellular phones](cell_phones.md) and
conducted an open demonstration in San Diego in November 1989.

The first CDMA network was launched commercially in 1995 as
[cdmaOne](cdmaone.md) and provided approximately 10 times more
capacity than analog networks. CDMA has become the fastest-growing of
all wireless technologies, with over 100 million subscribers worldwide.

## Benefits

- Greater capacity. Provides 10-20 times the capacity of analog
  equipment and three times the capacity of other digital platforms.
- Excellent voice and call quality through the filtering out of
  background noise, cross-talk, and interference.
- Rapid deployment. CDMA systems can be expanded quickly and more cost
  effectively than most landline networks.
- Fewer dropped calls.
- Improved security and privacy because of CDMA's digitally encoded
  transmissions.
- Reduced background noise and interference by combining multiple
  signals which improves signal strength.

## Forensics

Most CDMA phones do not use [SIM Cards](sim_cards.md), so
forensics can only be done on the phone itself, as all relevant data is
stored directly on the phone. This information includes the
[phonebook](phonebook.md), [call
history](call_history.md) log, [SMS](SMS "wikilink") messages,
and any calendar or to-do applications the phone might have.

Due to the fact that the phone must be physically connected to a
forensics workstation for data acquisition, it is important to be aware
of the phone's battery state (a charging cable should be obtained to
ensure constant power), and blocking the phone's signal. Also, the
correct data cable must be obtained to connect the phone to the
workstation ([susteen](susteen.md) provides a kit that includes
many cables for the most popular phones).

[RUIM](ruim.md) cards are the CDMA equivalent of a [SIM
Card](sim_card.md), and have been in use in china since 2002.
The technology has spread to other countries throughout Asia, although
are yet to be release in America.
