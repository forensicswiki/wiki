## About

Kali Linux is an open source project that is maintained and funded by
[Offensive Security](offensive_security.md), a provider of
world-class information security training and penetration testing
services. In addition to [Kali Linux](kali_linux.md), [Offensive
Security](offensive_security.md) also maintains the [Exploit
Database](exploit_database.md) and the free online course,
[Metasploit Unleashed](metasploit_unleashed.md).

## Features

Kali is a complete re-build of BackTrack Linux, adhering completely to
Debian development standards. All-new infrastructure has been put in
place, all tools were reviewed and packaged, and we use Git for our VCS.

- More than 300 penetration testing tools: After reviewing every tool
  that was included in [BackTrack](backtrack.md), we eliminated
  a great number of tools that either did not work or had other tools
  available that provided similar functionality.

<!-- -->

- Free and always will be: Kali Linux, like its predecessor, is
  completely free and always will be. You will never, ever have to pay
  for Kali Linux.

<!-- -->

- Open source Git tree: We are huge proponents of open source software
  and our development tree is available for all to see and all sources
  are available for those who wish to tweak and rebuild packages.

<!-- -->

- FHS compliant: Kali has been developed to adhere to the Filesystem
  Hierarchy Standard, allowing all Linux users to easily locate
  binaries, support files, libraries, etc.

<!-- -->

- Vast wireless device support: We have built Kali Linux to support as
  many wireless devices as we possibly can, allowing it to run properly
  on a wide variety of hardware and making it compatible with numerous
  USB and other wireless devices.

<!-- -->

- Custom kernel patched for injection: As penetration testers, the
  development team often needs to do wireless assessments so our kernel
  has the latest injection patches included. Secure development
  environment: The Kali Linux team is made up of a small group of
  trusted individuals who can only commit packages and interact with the
  repositories while using multiple secure protocols.

<!-- -->

- GPG signed packages and repos: All Kali packages are signed by each
  individual developer when they are built and committed and the
  repositories subsequently sign the packages as well. Multi-language:
  Although pentesting tools tend to be written in English, we have
  ensured that Kali has true multilingual support, allowing more users
  to operate in their native language and locate the tools they need for
  the job.

<!-- -->

- Completely customizable: We completely understand that not everyone
  will agree with our design decisions so we have made it as easy as
  possible for our more adventurous users to customize Kali Linux to
  their liking, all the way down to the kernel.

<!-- -->

- ARMEL and ARMHF support: Since ARM-based systems are becoming more and
  more prevalent and inexpensive, we knew that Kali’s ARM support would
  need to be as robust as we could manage, resulting in working
  installations for both ARMEL and ARMHF systems. Kali Linux has ARM
  repositories integrated with the mainline distribution so tools for
  ARM will be updated in conjunction with the rest of the distribution.

<!-- -->

- Kali is currently available for the following ARM devices:
  - rk3306 mk/ss808
  - Raspberry Pi
  - ODROID U2/X2
  - Samsung Chromebook

<!-- -->

- Kali is specifically tailored to penetration testing and therefore,
  all documentation on this site assumes prior knowledge of the Linux
  operating system.
