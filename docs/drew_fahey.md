[Drew Fahey](drew_fahey.md), VP of Products at Blackbag
Technologies where oversees all product development. Drew is somewhat a
computer nerd (just as Earth is somewhat a planet). He has spent over
fifteen years conducting incident response and forensic investigations
as both a federal agent with AFOSI and as a consultant. He was the
creator of the Helix Live CD. He holds several industry certifications
and a BS degree from Texas State University. If he was not so dedicated
to building the best forensic software for BlackBag, he would be
starring as the next Chuck, skiing in Colorado or playing Call of Duty.
