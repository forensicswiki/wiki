# Overview

[Advanced Digital Forensic Solutions,
Inc.](http://www.adfsolutions.com)(ADF Solutions, Inc., or ADF
Solutions) is a privately held, minority-owned small business based in
Bethesda, Maryland. The company was founded in 2005 by J.J. Wallia and
Raphael Bousquet.

ADF Solutions develops tools for media exploitation (MEDEX) and [digital
forensics](digital_forensics.md) triage. These tools scan
computers and digital devices and rapidly extract intelligence and
evidence to identify individuals who are a threat to public safety or
national security. They are used in digital forensic labs and used by
field operatives in defense, intelligence, law enforcement, border
security, and other government agencies worldwide.

# ADF Products

ADF offers [three main
products](http://http://www.adfsolutions.com/products/): Triage-G2,
Triage-Examiner, and Triage-Responder.

[Triage-G2](http://www.adfsolutions.com/products/triage-g2) is a media
exploitation ([medex](medex.md) tool used by field operatives
to extract intelligence from computers and peripheral devices. Triage-G2
was specifically designed to be used by nontechnical operators and
deployed using a small, portable triage key (a 32GB USB drive) that
doesn’t require a computer or other heavy equipment for field
deployment. The keys can be prepared in advance at the base or in the
field by using one click to select mission-specific search criteria.
Triage-G2 is used by several U.S. defense and intelligence agencies.

[Triage-Examiner](http://www.adfsolutions.com/products/triage-examiner)
is used by forensic examiners to scan suspect computers and prioritize
the computers for full forensic examinations. Triage-Examiner is used by
[Law Enforcement](law_enforcement.md) agencies worldwide.
Triage-Examiner Lab Add-On is an additional software component that
works with Triage-Examiner for examiners who need to run the software on
their laptops or forensic workstations to scan drive images, physical
drives, DVDs, CDs, and other removable media that are connected to the
workstation.

[Triage-Responder](http://www.adfsolutions.com/products/triage-responder)is
designed for nontechnical law enforcement investigators in the field to
scan suspect computers for evidence of a crime. This tool also uses
lightweight USB deployment and provides detailed field reporting
capabilities. This tool was developed in partnership with the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate.

# Discontinued Products

• Triage-Lab®
• Triage-Investigator®

# ADF Patented Technology

`ADF Solutions has been granted two U.S. patents (#7,941,386 and #8,219,588) for its SearchPak® technology.`

# SearchPak®

The SearchPak is a container of forensic search intelligence. It allows
analysts and operators to precisely describe the forensic search or data
exploitation to be conducted on a target system. As a secure container,
the SearchPak can be used to automate recurring data exploitation jobs
and can be shared among agencies or between operators. SearchPaks can be
user-defined and are encrypted with an AES 256-bit
[encryption](encryption.md) key.

Agencies can create their own SearchPaks and share them among examiners,
teams, and other operators.

SearchPaks can be generic or mission-specific:

Examples of Generic SearchPaks

> • Collect all pictures, videos, and documents accessed in the past six
> months on a target machine.
> • Detect any installed application that can facilitate hiding data.
> • Collect all iPhone backup files.

Examples of Mission-Specific SearchPaks

> • Collect files that match a set of known hash values.
> • Collect all documents, text files, or emails that contain the
> keyword “Operation Kandahar.”

# DHS S&T First Responder Cyber Forensic Field Kit

In 2010, ADF Solutions was selected by the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security Science and Technology Directorate to develop a universal
forensic triage field kit that would aid law enforcement officers in
extracting information and evidence from computers and other devices
being examined in active criminal or terrorist investigations. Once
extracted, the data can immediately be viewed, so investigators can take
appropriate action while saving the data for future forensic analysis.

As the result of this DHS initiative, ADF Solutions released
Triage-Responder in 2012. The tool is being deployed to federal, state,
and local law enforcement agencies throughout the U.S.

# Media Exploitation

ADF Solutions focuses on digital forensic triage and can be applied to
document and media exploitation. Triage-G2 has features designed
specifically for media exploitation.

According to technopedia.com, document and media exploitation is defined
as the extraction, translation, and analysis of physical and digital
documents and media to generate useful and timely information. Also
known as DOMEX, it is a very similar discipline to computer forensics or
digital forensics.
