**Adroit Photo Forensics** (**APF**) is a commercial forensic software
package distributed by [Digital Assembly](digital_assembly.md).
It specializes in the recovery and analysis of digital photographs.

# Features

Adroit Photo Forensics can parse a number of filesystems, including
[FAT](fat.md) 12/16/32, [NTFS](ntfs.md),
[HFS](hfs.md), and [HFS+](hfs%2B.md). It can read from
[EnCase](encase.md) as well as
[raw/dd](raw_image_format.md) images.

It is best known for implementing the
[SmartCarving](file_carving:smartcarving.md) and
[GuidedCarving](file_carving:guidedcarving.md) algorithms to
recover fragmented photos.

## Exif

Adroit Photo Forensics also parses exif data and can be used to view and
group files based on exif date stamps instead of file system date
stamps. APF also includes a full zoomable time-line viewer based on exif
and file system date stamps.

## Other Features

Adroit Photo Forensics interface is optimized for the display of photos.
APF also include grouping and sorting options that are photo relevant.
