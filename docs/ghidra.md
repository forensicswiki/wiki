Ghidra is a software reverse engineering (SRE) framework created and
maintained by the [National Security Agency Research Directorate](national_security_agency_research_directorate.md).
This framework includes a suite of full-featured, high-end software
analysis tools that enable users to analyze compiled code on a variety
of platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Capabilities include
disassembly, assembly, decompilation, graphing, and scripting, along
with hundreds of other features. Ghidra supports a wide variety of
processor instruction sets and executable formats and can be run in both
user-interactive and automated modes. Users may also develop their own
Ghidra plug-in components and/or scripts using Java or Python.

In support of NSA's Cybersecurity mission, Ghidra was built to solve
scaling and teaming problems on complex SRE efforts, and to provide a
customizable and extensible SRE research platform. NSA has applied
Ghidra SRE capabilities to a variety of problems that involve analyzing
malicious code and generating deep insights for SRE analysts who seek a
better understanding of potential vulnerabilities in networks and
systems.

The full release build can be downloaded from the project homepage.
