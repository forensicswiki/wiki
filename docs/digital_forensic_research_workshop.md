The **Digital Forensic Research Workshop** (**DFRWS**) was initiated in August
2001 to bring academic researchers and digital forensic investigators and
practitioners together for active discussion that addresses three major
objectives:

* Define the need and create the processes for the incorporation of a
  rigorous scientific method as a fundamental tenant of the evolving
  discipline of Digital Forensic Science.
* Develop a research agenda that considers practitioner requirements,
  multiple investigative environments and emphasizes real world
  usability.
* The discovery, explanation and presentation of conclusive, persuasive
  evidence that will meet the heightened scrutiny of the courts and
  other decision-makers in military and civilian environments.

Since 2001, an annual workshop has been held in various cities around
the US to present and discuss research topics. Archives are available as
well as a more detailed history.

## Sponsorships

Sponsors of the conference will gain visibility for their companies,
demonstrate their support of forensic research and development, and
contribute to the success of the conference. All sponsors will have
their logo listed on the DFRWS 2008 website with a link to their website
and will be listed in the printed proceedings. They will also get
recognition at specific events that they sponsor.

## DFRWS Challenges

## 2008

The [DFRWS 2008 Challenge](http://old.dfrws.org/2008/challenge/) focuses on the
development of Linux memory analysis techniques and the fusion of evidence from
memory, hard disk, and network. Since the DFRWS 2005 Challenge, there has been
significant progress in Windows memory analysis. Now, we are focusing on Linux
and on integrating evidence from multiple sources.

### 2017 - 2018

The 2017 - 2018 DFRWS Challenge is about the Internet of Things (IoT).
Analysis of devices and network data including a Smart TV Raspberry Pi
and Amazon Echo cloud data are part of the scenario.
