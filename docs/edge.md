**Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution**, or **EDGE** is a mobile
phone technology that enhances upon [GPRS](gprs.md).
Thoeretically, this allows data transfers three times faster than
standard [GPRS](gprs.md), but is not always the case. The
maxinmum data tranfer rate is 236 kbps but most networks runing EDGE are
only configured for a data transfer rate of 135 kbps. It can be used on
[GSM](gsm.md) and [TDMA](tdma.md) networks including
Cingular and T-Mobile. EDGE can be implemented with no modification to
the core network, the base station subsytem only need a transceiver
installed to support EDGE.
