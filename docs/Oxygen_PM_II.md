### Oxygen Phone Manager II for Symbian OS Smartphones

Oxygen Phone Manager II for Symbian OS smartphones v2.7.6 is an extended
forensic mode of data access which is compatible with Windows and
supports a wide range of phone-connectivity options, including
Bluetooth. While users gain total access to the content of
Symbian-powered phones, they leave data untouched with no noticeable
changes.

The program reads the content of a phone and stores it as an image on
the hard drive. This relieves users from running synchronization and
ensures faster data access with more efficient processing. Oxygen Phone
Manager II consists of options to access and edit contacts, calendar
items, to-do tasks, messages and multimedia content. The data can also
be exported to other standard applications, such as MS Outlook and
Address Book etc. The image saved to the hard drive also serves as a
backup copy. It protects you against accidental loss of valuable
forensic evidence. It ensures fast migration between phones of different
models and producers. At the same time, Oxygen Phone Manager II allows a
full-scale interactive access to phone content. You can use PC to edit
and send out messages, create or import contacts, access and modify
multimedia content. The program is a go-between that immediately
translates content changes between two operating systems. They can
access contacts, calendar, to-dos and the gallery from a tree of
expandable folders. There is a details panel in the phone browser that
shows the file size and other attributes. It also shows the overall size
and number of images, melodies and video clips, and their drive in which
they are present (local, flash card or ROM).

Separate windows show contacts, calendar items and to-dos. The fields
accessible from menus and submenus in Symbian media appear in one grid
and are easy to revise. It has an Outlook-style interface provides
access to Unicode SMS, MMS, e-mail and other messages. It offers many
options that you have in an email service such as file attachment
support, a reply with the original message included, a one-click
attachment playback, and others.
