**The Art of
Keylogging**[1](http://www.wetstonetech.com/cgi-bin/shop.cgi?view,32)

##

WetStone has created a unique virtualized cyber-safe environment where
investigators and information technology professionals can experiment
with key logging technologies, including both software based and
hardware based. Beyond the offensive use of these tools, investigators
will discover how to investigate keyloggers with varied sophistication
levels. To truly get into the mind of a cyber criminal an investigator
must know what they are looking for, and then deeply understand how the
tools they uncover work. Establishing this can mean the difference
between pulling the plug on a memory resident keyloggers, and losing all
traces of evidence, or uncovering the activity needed for prosecution.

**Is Someone Looking Over Your Shoulder?**

Desktops without keyboards, and laptops without keys are like baseball
without a bat. It is impossible to take away keyboards from computers
and still be efficient and functional. The question that then surfaces
is, how do we secure them? Keyboards are under attack from software and
hardware based tools designed to steal the content typed on the keys.
Whether infected at home or at work, keyloggers are responsible for
massive amounts of identity theft and corporate leakage of data.
