**Foremost** is a [Linux](linux.md) based program data for
[recovering deleted files](recovering_deleted_data.md) and
served as the basis for the more modern [Scalpel](scalpel.md).
The program uses a configuration file to specify [headers and
footers](file_formats.md) to search for. Intended to be run on
[disk images](disk_image.md), foremost can search through most
any kind of data without worrying about the format.

## History

Foremost was developed by [Jesse Kornblum](jesse_kornblum.md)
and [Kris Kendall](kris_kendall.md) when they served in the [Air
Force Office of Special
Investigations](air_force_office_of_special_investigations.md).
Originally designed to imitate the [Defense Computer Forensics
Lab's](defense_computer_forensics_lab.md)
**[carvthis](carvthis.md)** program, it gained popularity among
Air Force investigators and was eventually distributed to the general
public.

First published in 2000, a major update was released in 2005 when [Nick
Mikus](nick_mikus.md) joined the project.

## Spinoffs

Foremost served as the basis for [Golden G. Richard
III's](golden_g._richard_iii.md) [Scalpel](scalpel.md),
a significantly faster program to also recover [deleted
files](deleted_files.md). It has also inspired
[tcpxtract](tcpxtract.md), a program for extracting file from
network traffic.

Foremost's authors have recommended that practitioners use
[Scalpel](scalpel.md) instead of Foremost.

## Limitations

Due to programming difficulties, foremost is limited to processing files
smaller than 2GB.
