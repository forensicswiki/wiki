ATA is the AT Attachment interface, one of two major standards for
connecting storage media devices like hard drives to personal computers
(PCs). The opposing standard is [SCSI](scsi.md).

PATA is the Parallel ATA specification. Mostly incorrectly referred to
as IDE (Integrated Device Electronics) by a lot of vendors. SATA is the
Serial ATA specification.

ATAPI is an extension on the ATA standard for optical media, like CD,
DVD, Blu-Ray.
