## Tools

[log2timeline](log2timeline.md) - An artifact timeline creation and analysis
framework. Log2timeline has been superseded by Plaso.

<!-- -->

[Plaso](plaso.md) - (Plaso Langar Að Safna Öllu), or super timeline all the
things, is a Python-based engine used by several tools for automatic creation
of timelines. Plaso default behavior is to create super timelines but it also
supports creating more targeted timelines.
