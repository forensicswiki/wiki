The **Advanced Audio Coding** (**AAC**) file format is a lossy digital
audio encoding format. Files downloaded from the [iTunes Music
Store](itunes_music_store.md) are available in this format.

## Metadata

AAC files usually have a file ending of [.m4p](m4p.md) and
contain lots of [metadata](metadata.md). The output of the
[Unix](unix.md) [strings](strings "wikilink") command suggests
that at least the following information is contained:

- Name of the person who downloaded the file from the [iTunes Music
  Store](itunes_music_store.md)
- Email address of that person (sometimes)
- [Timestamp](timestamp.md) of when the file was downloaded
- Another timestamp (probably the date when the file was put into the
  [iTunes Music Store](itunes_music_store.md)?)
- The usual metadata of music files (artist, album, cover art etc.)
