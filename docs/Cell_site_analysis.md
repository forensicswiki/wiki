Cell Site Analysis (CSA) is the technical discipline of using mobile
telephony signals and network data to triangulate and identify the
relative geographic position of a device.

Cell site analysis is considered a highly intrusive surveillance
technique and as such normally deployed only in sensitive or serious
criminal investigations.

The technique can assist in demonstrating the co-location (meeting) of
individuals, their movements over time, proximity to a scene of crime,
and to verify the any defence alibi evidence.
