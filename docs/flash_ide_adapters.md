A **Flash IDE Adapter** allows [flash memory](flash_memory.md)
to be accessed from a host computer as if it were an
[IDE](ide.md) drive. This is normally used to allow systems to
boot off flash memory, but it can also be used to allow forensic
analysis of Flash RAM as if it were a local disk, without going through
a flash to USB adapter.
