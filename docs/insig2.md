Criminal intelligence analysis is an essential component of effective
policing, at both the operational and strategic levels. The analysts
study data related to criminals, crime suspects, incidents, issues, and

relationships or connections between different crimes in different
places and provide insights that can drive or support law enforcement
investigations, operations, and strategy, as well as influencing
government policy and decisions.
