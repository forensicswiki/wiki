A computer forensics investigator is the individual responsible for the
practice of identifying, extracting and considering evidence from
digital media, such as computer hard drives. [Digital
evidence](Digital_evidence "wikilink") is both fragile and volatile and
requires the attention of the investigator, which should be a qualified
specialist, to ensure that materials of evidentiary value can be
effectively isolated and extracted in a scientific manner that will bear
the scrutiny of a court of law.

The vernacular of digital or computer *forensics investigator* is
*forensicator*.
