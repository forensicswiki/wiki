The **Integrated Digital Enhanced Network** (**iDEN**) is a proprietary
mobile communications technology from [Motorola](motorola.md).
It is a [TDMA](tdma.md) based digital wireless standard that
operates in the 800 MHz, 900MHz, and 1.5 GHz bands. It combines the
capabilities of a [digital cellular telephone](cell_phones.md)
and a two-way radio known as [push-to-talk](push-to-talk.md)
([ptt](ptt.md).

Motorola’s iDEN technology phones support many other features including
[Bluetooth](bluetooth.md), location-based services,
[MOTOTalk](mototalk.md) and support for expandable memory
([Micro SD](micro_sd.md). [Sprint
Nextel](sprint_nextel.md) is the largest U.S. retailer of iDEN
services.

Newer iDEN phones use a [SIM card](sim_card.md) that is
compatible with [GSM](gsm.md) phones for overseas roaming but
iDEN is a very different standard from GSM. iDEN phones are not
compatible with GSM networks and GSM phones are not compatible with iDEN
networks.

## History

iDEN was invented by Motorola who is presently the primary manufacturer
of iDEN devices.

[Nextel](nextel.md) has started to develop a 2.5G technology
called **WiDEN** (an expansion of iDEN) that includes four carriers
(100kHz) into one channel. This results in a much higher download speed
of 96 kbit/s.

## Software

Software for acquiring a iDEN data includes:

- [iDEN Companion Pro](iden_companion_pro.md)
- [iDEN Media Downloader](iden_media_downloader.md)
- [iDEN Phonebook Manager](iden_phonebook_manager.md)
- [SIMiFOR](simifor.md)
- [SIM Explorer](sim_explorer.md)
