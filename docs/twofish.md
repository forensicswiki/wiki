**Twofish** is an [encryption](encryption.md) algorithm designed
designed by [Bruce Schneier](bruce_schneier.md), John Kelsey,
Doug Whiting, David Wagner, Chris Hall, and Niels Ferguson, Eli Biham
and Lars Knudsen as a candidate for the Advanced Encryption Standard
[AES](aes.md) competition, where it got third place with 31
votes ([rijndael](rijndael.md) got 86 votes, and was selected by
[NIST](nist.md) as the [AES](aes.md), and
[Serpent](serpent.md).

Twofish is a symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 128 bits
and key sizes up to 256 bits. It is related to the earlier
[Blowfish](blowfish.md) block cipher, also designed by [Bruce
Schneier](bruce_schneier.md).
