ILooK was the digital forensic analysis tool used in the investigation
of the 9/11 attacks. Originally available only for law enforcement, the
application is now being supported by XtremeForensics who have released
ILooKIX v9 for commercial use in two versions, Standard and Advanced.

ILooKIX can support a wide variety of file systems, including
[FAT](fat.md) 12/16/32, [NTFS](ntfs.md), NTFS Compressed, (Classic) HFS,
[HFS+](hfs+.md), [ext2, ext3](extended_file_system_(ext).md),
[ReiserFS](reiserfs.md) 1, 2, and 3,
SysV-AFS, SysV-EAFS, SysV-HTFS, NWFS, NWFS Compressed, VMWare Drive Mount Disk Drives,
Microsoft Virtual PC disks. It can also process CDs in CDFS, ISO 9660, and
UDF.

Over the past few years ILooKIX has undergone a huge amount of
development, particularly in relation to Apple file systems, and Version
10 is now available for use outside of the law enforcement, intelligence
and military environments. In addition, to cater for the needs of
practitioners working on smaller cases, there is now a 'Standard'
version which has the majority of the features included in the
'Advanced' version but it is restricted to a case database size of 10GB
(more than enough to process single-system cases).

[Hashkeeper hash database](hashkeeper.md) and
[NIST hash library](national_software_reference_library.md)
using [MD5](md5.md) and FIPS 180-2 compliant algorithms (e.g.
[SHA-1](sha-1.md).
