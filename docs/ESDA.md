**ESDA** which stands for Electrostatic detection apparatus, is a
machine used within forensics for document examination. The machine
allows the visulisation of indented writing wihout damaging the
document.

The questioned document (usually a piece of paper) is put onto the
bronze plate, then a thin film is placed over it. A corona (a highly
charged wire)then passes over the film, giving it an electrostatic
charge. The areas in which the paper is indented will have the greatest
charge. Once the corona has passed over the film, the bronze plate is
titled and photocopy toner powder (with small glass beads) is added. The
toner then adds to the areas of greatest charge, and thus allows the
indentation to now be seen.
