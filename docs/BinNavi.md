BinNavi is a binary analysis IDE - an environment that allows users to
inspect, navigate, edit, and annotate control-flow-graphs of
disassembled code, do the same for the callgraph of the executable,
collect and combine execution traces, and generally keep track of
analysis results among a group of analysts.
