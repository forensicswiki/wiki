Stego Suite is comprised of four specialized products: Stego Hunter™,
Stego Watch™, Stego Analyst™, and Stego Break™. This comprehensive suite
of applications is designed to quickly identify, examine and analyze
digital images and/or audio files for the presence of hidden information
or covert communication channels. Detecting the presence of
steganography is a tedious process; without advanced tools it is close
to impossible to detect. Using Stego Suite investigators are able to
utilize the latest algorithms for flagging suspicious files through a
blind anomaly-based approach, examine files with image filters, analyze
DCT coefficient histograms, and track palette manipulation with close
color pairs, shortening investigation time drastically and allowing
investigators to work specifically within the four tools provided in the
suite.
