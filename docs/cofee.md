**Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor (COFEE)**

COFEE is a collection of Microsoft software designed to all the easy
capture of important "live" computer evidence at the scene in cybercrime
investigations, without special forensics expertise.

The fully customizable tool allows your on-the-scene agents to run more
than 150 commands on a live computer system. It also provides reports in
a simple format for later interpretation by experts or as supportive
evidence for subsequent investigation and prosecution. And the COFEE
framework can be tailored to effectively meet the needs of your
particular investigation. To help combat the growing number of ways that
criminals use computers and the Internet to commit crimes, Microsoft is
working with INTERPOL and the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C)
to provide COFEE at no cost to law enforcement agencies in 187 countries
worldwide. INTERPOL and NW3C are also working with Florida State
University and University College Dublin to continue the research and
development that will help ensure that COFEE serves the needs of law
enforcement, even as technology evolves.

Law enforcement can get COFEE from NW3C at www.nw3c.org or by contacting
INTERPOL at COFEE@interpol.int.
