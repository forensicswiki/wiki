Tools libraries and frameworks built by or for goverment agencies often,
although essentialy being "open source", can not be freely shared and
redistributed.

In the most strict cases an [NDA](nda.md) is used, but in some
cases instead of this a **scoped distribution** is defined. With scoped
distribution it is allowed to (re)distribute the product, but only under
the conditions mentioned by the scope. An often used scope for forensic
tools is the [LEA only](lea_only.md)
scope.
