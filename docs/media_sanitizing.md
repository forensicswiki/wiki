Media Sanitizing is the process of removing data, or removing the
ability to extract data, from the media on which it is stored. The two
main methods used are Clearing or Purging and Destruction. The method
chosen will depend largly on whether the media is required to be reused
or recycled. However, care should be taken even with some purging
methods, degausing for example can destroy the equipment.

Gutmann's 1996 paper on [Recovering Overwritten
Data](recovering_overwritten_data.md) suggested that media
sanitization (at least by overwriting) was futile as it was always
possible to recover the data, although he acknowledged that overwriting
multiple times made the recovery difficult, and perhaps prohibitivly
expensive. Later he advised that overwriting twice would suffice for
most situations - See [Epilogue to Gutmann's 1996
paper](epilogue_to_gutmann's_1996_paper.md). The need to
overwrite multiple times is regarded as a myth by some who point out
that this is only possible with extremly expensive laboratory equipment
and that there is no software recovery technique which will recover data
overwritten even once (if it is in fact overwritten). See [Joukov
Papaxenopoulos & Zadok (2006)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1179559.1179571)

Detailed instructions on media sanitization have been published by NIST as
Special Publication 800-88.
