[Paraben](paraben.md)'s **Wireless StrongHold Bag** is an
"evidence bag" for wireless radio frequency devices, for
[PDAs](pdas.md), [Cell Phones](Cell_Phones "wikilink"), and
[SmartPhones](smartphones.md).

In order to prevent a wireless device from connecting to the network,
the device (e.g. a [Cell Phone](cell_phone.md) can be placed
inside of a [RF Isolation bag](rf_isolation_bag.md) or [faraday
bag](faraday_bag.md) to blocks radio transmissions.

[First responders](first_responder.md) can help to maintain the
integrity of evidence contained in wireless devices through the use of
this equipment. It should be noted that power should be supplied to the
device if the data is volatile in nature, but the cable may introduce a
pathway for electromagnetic signals to penetrate the controlled
environment.

One example of such a kit is Paraben's Wireless StrongHold Bag. This bag
is weaved from three layers of nickel, copper, and nylon silver. The
company also produces a [StrongHold Tent](stronghold_tent.md),
which allows the investigator to enter the radio signal dampened
environment and also to bring in other equipment, such as
[laptops](laptop.md), in order to facilitate the investigation.
As with any type of tool, RF isolation must be thoroughly tested before
introduction to actual digital evidence.
