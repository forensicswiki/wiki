Motorola has discontinued support of Companion Pro as their new but
inferior "[iDEN Phonebook Manager](iDEN_Phonebook_Manager "wikilink")"
software has been released.

You can still use the new Phonebook Manager, if you don't care about
speed dial ordering (like holding "1" to call home, etc.), or
cut-and-paste to copy contacts from an Excel spreadsheet instead of
entering 1 by 1 with their awkward interface.
