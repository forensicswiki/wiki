## Security

SIM cards can have their data protected by a PIN, or Personal
Identification Number. If a user has enabled the PIN on their SIM card,
the SIM will remain locked until the PIN is properly entered. Some
phones provide the option of using a second PIN, or PIN2, to further
protect data. If a user incorrectly enters their PIN number multiple
times, the phone may request a PUK, or Personal Unblocking Key. The
number of times a PIN must be incorrectly entered before the phone
requests the PUK will vary from phone to phone. Once a phone requests a
PUK, the SIM will remain locked until the PUK is correctly entered. The
PUK must be obtained from the SIM's network provider. If a PUK is
incorrectly entered 10 times the SIM will become permanently locked and
the user must purchase a new SIM card in order to use the phone. In some
cases the phone will request a PUK2 before it permanently locks the SIM
card.
