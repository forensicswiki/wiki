## CopyCatX

[CopyCatX](http://www.subrosasoft.com/OSXSoftware/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=200&products_id=7)
allows you to create exact duplicates of your hard drive, Apple iPod, or
Mac OS X startup drive.
[CopyCatX](http://www.subrosasoft.com/OSXSoftware/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=200&products_id=7)
is the fastest way to duplicate devices in most formats on your Apple
Macintosh computer.

The fastest software duplication system for Mac OS X.
[CopyCatX](http://www.subrosasoft.com/OSXSoftware/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=200&products_id=7)
is extremely fast. It works on drives that other systems cannot recover
by using our proprietary resumable/fault tolerant algorithms.

Backups include every single detail of the original including
permissions, icons, placement, and content.

Unlike most backup programs which copy file-by-file,
[CopyCatX](http://www.subrosasoft.com/OSXSoftware/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=200&products_id=7)
utilizes a method called device copying. Device copying enables you to
retain every detail of the original volume. It's a lot faster than the
traditional method of backing up file-by-file. When duplicating a
volume,
[CopyCatX](http://www.subrosasoft.com/OSXSoftware/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=200&products_id=7)
is smart enough to skip all the blank space of a drive during the
copying process to further improve the speed.

## VolumeWorks

[VolumeWorks](http://www.subrosasoft.com/OSXSoftware/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=200&products_id=6)
is an extremely powerful OS X software application for managing the
partitions on your hard drive. VolumeWorks is designed to allow the end
user the ability to:

- Rebuild a partition table
- Add partitions to a device
- Hide partitions
- Shift partitions
- Resize partitions

## DasBoot

[DasBoot](http://www.subrosasoft.com/OSXSoftware/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=200&products_id=193)
Do you have a shiny new flash drive, or multi use storage device in your
pocket ? Now you can turn it into a Mac OS X diagnostic, repair, and
maintenance tool. DasBoot allows you to take any third party boot CD
(such as those shipped by SubRosaSoft.com Inc, Prosoft Engineering Inc,
Alsoft Inc, or Micromat Inc) and quickly create a bootable diagnostic
device that contains any of your own utilities you may wish to install.

You can use your device to boot and repair Mac OS X computers\* as
needed without erasing it and taking away your ability to use it for
other purposes such as playing music, or watching videos. With the help
of DasBoot™ you get to carry all the tools you'll need with you. But
unlike expensive third party alternatives, you'll have plenty of space
left over in case you need to recover data.

DasBoot™ devices run software much faster than a CD/DVD repair disk. In
addition you can re-configure the device at any time to add new
utilities, updated versions of software or newer versions of Mac OS X.

## MusicRenamer

[MusicRenamer](http://www.subrosasoft.com/OSXSoftware/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=200&products_id=186)
is Mac OS X software to quickly and easily rename large numbers of music
files.
[MusicRenamer](http://www.subrosasoft.com/OSXSoftware/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=200&products_id=186)
is a powerful mp3 file renaming tool. It helps to avoid spending hours
of hard boring manual editing of mp3 filenames. You will rename your mp3
filenames easier and faster and...you'll see your mp3 list with
consistent order in filenames. The renamer converts easily any rare and
strange filename to a simple format containing the album name, track
number, artist and title. You will be asked to select a folder that
contains MP3, AAC, M4A, or M4P files. These files will be renamed based
on the ID3 tags contained within them. If no ID3 tags are found the
filename will be left unaltered.
