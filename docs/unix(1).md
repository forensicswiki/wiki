**Unix** or **UNIX** is a general-purpose multi-user [operating
system](operating_system.md) developed mostly by [Ken
Thompson](ken_thompson.md) and [Dennis
Ritchie](dennis_ritchie.md) during 1969 at [Bell
Labs](bell_labs.md). About one year later during the early 1970s
UNIX was unveiled to the general public. The original goal as it is
today was to create a stable, secure, and powerful operating system that
is portable to many different hardware platforms.

Today UNIX has evolved into three main categories which all flavors of
UNIX derive from: [BSD](bsd.md),
[System V](system_v.md) Release 4, and hybrid. Some of the most
poplar flavors of UNIX are: [IBM](ibm.md)’s
[AIX](aix.md), [Sun Microsystems](Sun_Microsystems "wikilink")'
[Solaris](solaris.md), [SGI](SGI "wikilink")’s
[IRIX](irix.md), [Linux](Linux "wikilink"),
[OpenBSD](openbsd.md), and [FreeBSD](FreeBSD "wikilink").
