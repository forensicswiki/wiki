**Spyware** is software installed physically on the device with the
intent to steal data such as [SMS](sms.md) or location data.
This data is collected over a period of time. The spyware application
then sends this data to the person who installed the spyware to their
mobile device or email. Spyware by itself is legal to use. However, it
is illegal to install spyware onto a person's device without their
consent.
