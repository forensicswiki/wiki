**Scalpel** is an [open source](open_source.md) program for
[recovering deleted data](recovering_deleted_data.md) originally
based on [foremost](foremost.md), although significantly more
efficient. Originally developed by [Golden G. Richard
III](golden_g._richard_iii.md) and presented at the
[DFRWS](digital_forensic_research_workshop.md) conference in
2005, it allows an examiner to specify a number of headers and footers
to recover filetypes from a piece of media. Scalpel is maintained by
[Golden G. Richard III](golden_g._richard_iii.md) and [Lodovico
Marziale](lodovico_marziale.md). Currently, Scalpel is being
incorporated into the [Sleuthkit](sleuthkit.md) and is now
hosted on GitHub.
