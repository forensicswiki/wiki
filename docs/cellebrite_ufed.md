The **Cellebrite 'Universal Forensic Extraction Device' (UFED)** is a
tool for mobile phone, smartphone, and PDA forensics. As of September
2010 the UFED was compatible with over 2,500 mobile phones (including
GSM, TDMA, CDMA, iDEN). The standard package containing several dozen
phone cables. The UFED had an intergrated SIM reader, with Wireless
connection options also being integrated, such as IR and Bluetooth.

The UFED also supports native Apple iPOD Touch, and Apple iPHONE
extraction on both 2G and 3G versions, as well as iOS4. This is
clientless, and via a physical cable, and works on jailbroken and
non-jailbroken devices.

Subject data can be retrieved via logical extraction or via physical
extraction (ie: hex dump). Moreover, all cable connectors from subject
(source) side act as a write-blocker, being read only via the onboard
hardware chipset. Extracted data includes basic handset data, the
phonebook, SMS and MMS messages, SIM data, multimedia (e.g. images and
videos stored on the phone), and time and date stamps.
