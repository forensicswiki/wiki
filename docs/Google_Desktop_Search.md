Google Desktop Search is an application for both
[Windows](Windows "wikilink") and [Mac OS X](Mac_OS_X "wikilink") that
allows the user to index and then search their local hard drives. These
applications integrate with other Google tools such as searching the web
and [Gmail](Gmail "wikilink").

By default, the Mac version caches content that can be recovered even
after the original has been deleted.

Google Desktop will be discontinued as of September 14 2011
