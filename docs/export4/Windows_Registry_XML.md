Microsoft's .reg format for representing MS Registry entries has many
limitations, such as the inability to represent where registry
information physically resides on the disk and the difficulty in
representing Unicode. As a result, a variety of approaches have been
implemented. Currently DFXML uses the [RegXML](RegXML "wikilink")
standard to represent Registry entries.

Windows Registry:

- [registryasxml](registryasxml "wikilink") is a Windows GUI program

  XML-foramtted files.
- [RegXML](RegXML "wikilink") is also a Windows command-line utility
  that exports sections of the Windows Registry as XML-formatted files.

  has a \$195 .NET too that allows management, importing and exporting
  of the registry via XML.
