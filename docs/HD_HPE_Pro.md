## Overview

HD HPE PRO is a [hard drive](hard_drive "wikilink") platter replacement
and disk head exchange tool built to handle head stack and DSM issues
produced by [SalvationDATA](SalvationDATA "wikilink").

Besides firmware problem and well known file system problems, as a data
recovery professional, you must have experiences that drives click and
drive spin motor got stuck or burnt. For few of you, these kinds of
problems can be fixed by replacing the damaged parts manually, but for
most of the non-experts who want to lay their hands on this bite of
cake, it is better if they work in a stable environment with assistance
of industrial designed utilities to prevent further damages or misalign
because of incorrect operations to maintain the user data intact.

## Highlights of HD HPE PRO

- Universal-fit workbench assures you to operate on your HD on a
  relatively stable table, making your job easier and more reliable.

- Platter exchanger maintains the original cylinder status by removing
  and placing each platter of the multiple platters together, so that
  allows you to change multiple platters without moving the platters out
  of alignment with each other which otherwise will result in data
  corruption.

- Special Actuator Remover assures you to perform easy operation
  (removal, installation) on the upper magnet of the actuator which is
  very hard to be removed and put back because of its strong magnetism
  and it’s sensitive and embarrassed position (being very close to both
  the Head Stack and Media Platter), in case it slips out and touch
  either of its fragile neighbors during the operations — the
  consequences will be a disaster.
