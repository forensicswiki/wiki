**EnCase** is a family of all-in-one computer forensics suites sold by
[Guidance Software](guidance_software.md). These products
include EnCase Enterprise, EnCase Forensic Edition, EnCase eDiscovery,
and EnCase Lab Edition. These programs use a proprietary image file
format that has been reverse engineered. Users can create scripts,
called [EnScripts](enscripts.md), to automate tasks.

## History

Expert Witness (for Windows) was the original name for EnCase (dating
back to 1998). More info about this can be found on the Internet Archive

including a demo of the original software

## File Format

See [Encase image file format](encase_image_file_format.md)

## Hash Databases

EnCase uses [MD5](md5.md) hashes and stores them in its
proprietary [Encase hash file format](encase_hash_files.md);
either individually or in a "hash map". EnCase supports importing hashes
from the [NSRL](national_software_reference_library.md),
[Hashkeeper](hashkeeper.md), and plain MD5 files.
