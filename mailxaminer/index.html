<p>Emails from both; web based &amp; desktop based email services can be
scanned for analysis purpose. Two types of modes featured to scan emails
are as; Single File Mode and Bulk File Mode. In Single File Mode only
one file of a single type can be processed at a time. While Bulk File
Mode supports multiple files of different types to be scanned at once.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: In case if a corrupt data file or file containing deleted
emails is selected for analysis; MailXaminer recovers it through email
scanning process.</p>
<p>The email data scanning stage also offers internet bandwidth throttling
and email filter.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Throttle Option</em>: It is for web/cloud based email downloading, to
  specify the desired amount of internet packet to be consumed.</li>

authorities and officials having access of the Admin credentials will be
able to conduct email examination on the account data of GApps using
this email analysis application.</p>
<p><strong>Other Conditions</strong>: No IMAP support is required. However, the user /
examiner will have to create a separate project and has to be logged
into it during the examination is being channelized on the GApps account
data.</p>
<h2 id="live-exchange-mailbox-impersonation">Live Exchange Mailbox Impersonation</h2>
<p>Email client and server environments usually found in corporate &amp;
enterprises are the most common targets of email based crimes and
forgeries. User accounts from Live Exchange Server can be examined using
either the respective mailbox credentials or impersonation rights
(authority owned by a user for accessing a particular mailbox).
Impersonation can be implemented to use:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Provide Exchange Details</em>: Exchange Server versions (2007 – 2013 are
  supported), Server Name/IP, and Domain Name.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="image-analysis">Image Analysis</h2>
<p>An Image Analysis feature is provided to expand the possibility of
spotting pornographic images (of all types) scanned from emails
attachments, email body, contacts, compressed files, etc., amongst other
images. Once image analysis is switched on, any format of image
available in any file type will be thoroughly and detected for
obscenity. There are four sensitivity parameters provided by the tool to
adjust the intensity of executing skin tone analysis on images:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very Low</li>
<li>Low</li>
<li>High</li>
<li>Very High</li>
</ul>
<p>Higher the frequency more will be the detection rate and higher will be
the chances of false positive rate being provided. Once detected the
tree structure pane on the software lists all suspect detected images in
the frequency category under the respective source, i.e. file types in
which they have been detected.
<strong>NOTE</strong>: To receive the exact and sharp results, it is recommended to
set the frequency to High (not "Very High").</p>
<h2 id="video-analysis">Video Analysis</h2>
<p>The video analysis feature is meant for tracking and spotting the
attached video files having pornographic content. After the video
analysis mode is switched ON and the suspect evidence file is scanned,
the available malicious video can be easily spotted. The sensitivity
measure for the video analysis works in the similar pattern as mentioned
in the skin tone analysis attribute.</p>
<h2 id="geo-location-image-mapping">Geo Location Image Mapping</h2>
<p>The image attachments having the latitude, longitude and altitude
coordinates saved within them can be easily mapped. Export such image
attachments to KML format and thus, easily locate the exact location by
importing the KML file into Google Earth.</p>
<h2 id="evidence-search">Evidence Search</h2>
<p>Apart from the bulk email analysis, the program can perform selective
email analysis via its advanced search facility. The search feature
works rapidly on a keyword basis. Investigators can either analyze
emails, searched using a single keyword or even with multiple keywords.
The keywords / keyword CSV provided in the case at the beginning can be
supplied to the search to detect associated emails.</p>
<h3 id="keyword-based-search">Keyword Based Search</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add Keywords</li>
<li>Browse CSV</li>
<li>Use Both</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advanced-search">Advanced Search</h3>
<h4 id="general">General</h4>
<p>The search offers generic search to be performed on the overall data of
the scanned files. The search process can be narrowed using different
search criteria like; subject, sender ID, recipient ID, etc. The search
is further divided into four more categorizations</p>
<ul>
<li>Wildcard Search: It offers the chance of performing a search using
  incomplete terms with an asterisk (*) or question mark (?) along with
  the search criteria provided to list associated results.</li>
<li>Regular Expression Search: Can also be termed as special character
  based search for specific findings, carried out using a combination of
  patterns created by a number of special characters.</li>
<li>Stem Search: The option provides possible search results associated
  with the term used for searching on the investigator being uncertain
  about the exact word to look up for.</li>
<li>Fuzzy Search: This multi-valued component based search offers results
  matching the combination of words differentiated with symbol or
  special characters to list the nearest possible results.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="predefined">Predefined</h4>
<p>Based on the Regular Expressions search algorithm, this search option
helps detect email message pattern with the use of category and sub
category search like; phone numbers, URLs, addresses, postal code, etc.,
and country, respectively.</p>
<h4 id="advance">Advance</h4>
<p>This search option offers the most comprehensive and in-depth
exploration of data within the file(s). Multiple number of search
criteria can be added along with conjunctions for added detail and to
look up for information in the message body, attachment, as well as
email header.</p>
<h4 id="proximity">Proximity</h4>
<p>Based on the hit &amp; trial method of searching, the option provides a
search field for adding look up terms to be added and searched for
approximate results between the terms ranging from zero to infinity.
<strong>NOTE</strong>: Maximum four words / terms can be added at once.</p>
<ul>
<li>Distance Between Words: Enter the approximate amount of words that
  separate the mentioned terms to search.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="case-evidence-bookmarking">Case Evidence Bookmarking</h2>
<p>Evidences collected from email artifacts can be bookmarked for future
analysis purposes. Evidences in the form of emails, media files,
keywords, and search results can be bookmarked. The bookmarks section
will contain a record of case related evidences bookmarked which can
further be exported, sent for review, deleted, or comments can be added
to it.</p>
<h2 id="export-email-data-artifacts">Export Email Data Artifacts</h2>
<p>On the completion of email data file recovery and analysis, evidences
can be exported into multiple formats of output file according to the
type of data. The software is built to support multiple types of export,
including; email, media files, search results, bookmarks, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Emails</em>: Emails are exported into the following file types; CSV,
  Concordance, EML, TIFF, MSG, PDF, PST, and can also be printed
  directly in bulk.</li>
<li><em>Search Results / Bookmarks</em>: Bookmarks and search results are

  artifacts of any type are exportable in respective formats.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="email-tagging-with-labels">Email Tagging With Labels</h2>
<p>Emails of particular importance or category can be tagged under the
respective label using the email tagging feature. Email tagging makes
classification of email based evidences easier and quicker to organize
the investigation to next level. Multiple tags can be created under
which selective email evidences can be labeled by an investigator for
future analysis, categorization, or purposes whatsoever. Further, the
emails tagged under a category can also be removed off from their
respective tags using the remove tag option provided along with add tag
facility.</p>
<h2 id="section-508-compliance">Section 508 Compliance</h2>
