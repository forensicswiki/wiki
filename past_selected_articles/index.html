<p>Abstract: Criminal investigations today can hardly be imagined without
the forensic analysis of digital devices, regardless of whether it is a
desktop computer, a mobile phone, or a navigation system. This not only
holds true for cases of cybercrime, but also for traditional delicts
such as murder or blackmail, and also private corporate investigations
rely on digital forensics. This leads to an increasing number of cases
with an ever-growing amount of data, that exceeds the capacity of the
forensic experts. To support investigators to work more efficiently, we
introduce a novel approach to automatically reconstruct events that
previously occurred on the examined system and to provide a quick
overview to the investigator as a starting point for further
investigation. In contrast to the few existing approaches, our solution
does not rely on any previously profiled system behavior or knowledge
about specific applications, log files, or file formats. We further
present a prototype implementation of our so-called zero knowledge event
reconstruction approach, that solely tries to make sense of
characteristic structures in file system metadata such as file- and
folder-names and timestamps.</p>

criminal acquisition and distribution of child pornography (CP). In this
paper, we examine observations of peers sharing known CP on the eMule
and Gnutella networks, which were collected by law enforcement using
forensic tools that we developed. We characterize a year's worth of
network activity and evaluate different strategies for prioritizing
investigators' limited resources. The highest impact research in
criminal forensics works within, and is evaluated under, the constraints
and goals of investigations. We follow that principle, rather than
presenting a set of isolated, exploratory characterizations of users.</p>
<p>First, we focus on strategies for reducing the number of CP files
available on the network by removing a minimal number of peers. We
present a metric for peer removal that is more effective than simply
selecting peers with the largest libraries or the most days online.
Second, we characterize six aggressive peer subgroups, including: peers
using Tor, peers that bridge multiple p2p networks, and the top 10% of
peers contributing to file availability. We find that these subgroups
are more active in their trafficking, having more known CP and more
uptime, than the average peer. Finally, while in theory Tor presents a
challenge to investigators, we observe that in practice offenders use
Tor inconsistently. Over 90% of regular Tor users send traffic from a
non-Tor IP at least once after first using Tor.</p>

the launch of Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), Apple has introduced a volume
encryption mechanism known as FileVault 2. Apple only disclosed
marketing aspects of the closed-source software, e.g. its use of the
AES-XTS tweakable encryption, but a publicly available security
evaluation and detailed description was unavailable until now.. We have
performed an extensive analysis of FileVault 2 and we have been able to
ﬁnd all the algorithms and parameters needed to successfully read an
encrypted volume. This allows us to perform forensic investigations on
encrypted volumes using our own tools. In this paper we present the
architecture of FileVault 2, giving details of the key derivation,
encryption process and metadata structures needed to perform the volume
decryption. Besides the analysis of the system, we have also built a
library that can mount a volume encrypted with FileVault 2. As a
contribution to the research and forensic communities we have made this
library open source. Additionally, we present an informal security
evaluation of the system and comment on some of the design and

</bibtex> Many technical mechanisms across computer security for
attribution, identiﬁcation, and classiﬁcation are neither sufﬁcient nor
necessary for forensically valid digital investigations; yet they are
often claimed as useful or necessary. Similarly, when forensic research
is evaluated using the viewpoints held by computer security venues, the
challenges, constraints, and usefulness of the work is often misjudged.
In this paper, we point out many key aspects of digital forensics with
the goal of ensuring that research seeking to advance the discipline
will have the highest possible adoption rate by practitioners. We
enumerate general legal and practical constraints placed on forensic
investigators that set the ﬁeld apart. We point out the assumptions,
often limited or incorrect, made about forensics in past work, and
discuss how these assumptions limit the impact of contributions.</p>

<p></bibtex> The recent diversification of telephony infrastructure allows
users to communicate through landlines, mobile phones and VoIP phones.
However, call metadata such as Caller-ID is either not transferred or
transferred without verification across these networks, allowing
attackers to maliciously alter it. In this paper, we develop PinDr0p, a
mechanism to assist users in determining call provenance — the source
and the path taken by a call. Our techniques detect and mea- sure
single-ended audio features to identify all of the applied voice codecs,
calculate packet loss and noise profiles, while remaining agnostic to
characteristics of the speaker’s voice (as this may le- gitimately
change when interacting with a large organization). In the absence of
verifiable call metadata, these features in combina- tion with machine
learning allow us to determine the traversal of a call through as many
as three different providers (e.g., cellular, then VoIP, then PSTN and
all combinations and subsets thereof) with 91.6% accuracy. Moreover, we
show that once we identify and characterize the networks traversed, we
can create detailed fin- gerprints for a call source. Using these
fingerprints we show that we are able to distinguish between calls made
using specific PSTN, cellular, Vonage, Skype and other hard and soft
phones from loca- tions across the world with over 90% accuracy. In so
doing, we provide a first step in accurately determining the provenance
of a call.</p>

ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), Volume 42, Issue 1 (December 2009)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Internet geolocation technology aims to determine the physical
(geographic) location of Internet users and devices. It is currently
proposed or in use for a wide variety of purposes, including targeted
marketing, restricting digital content sales to authorized
jurisdictions, and security applications such as reducing credit card
fraud. This raises questions about the veracity of claims of accurate
and reliable geolocation. We provide a survey of Internet geolocation
technologies with an emphasis on adversarial contexts; that is, we
consider how this technology performs against a knowledgeable
adversary whose goal is to evade geolocation. We do so by examining
first the limitations of existing techniques, and then, from this
base, determining how best to evade existing geolocation techniques.
We also consider two further geolocation techniques which may be of
use even against adversarial targets: (1) the extraction of client IP
addresses using functionality introduced in the 1.5 Java API, and (2)
the collection of round-trip times using HTTP refreshes. These
techniques illustrate that the seemingly straightforward technique of
evading geolocation by relaying traffic through a proxy server (or
network of proxy servers) is not as straightforward as many end-users
might expect. We give a demonstration of this for users of the popular
Tor anonymizing network.</p>

<p>Crime and courtroom proceedings have long been fodder for film and
television scriptwriters. In recent years, however, the media's use of
the courtroom as a vehicle for drama has not only proliferated, it has
changed focus. In apparent fascination with our criminal justice
process, many of today's courtroom dramas are based on actual cases.
Court TV offers live gavel-to-gavel coverage of trials over the Internet
for \$5.95 a month. Now, that's "reality television"!</p>
<p>Reality and fiction have begun to blur with crime magazine television
shows such as 48 Hours Mystery, American Justice, and even, on occasion,
Dateline NBC. These programs portray actual cases, but only after
extensively editing the content and incorporating narration for dramatic
effect. Presenting one 35-year-old cold case, for example, 48 Hours
Mystery filmed for months to capture all pretrial hearings as well as
the 2-week trial; the program, however, was ultimately edited to a
1-hour episode that suggested the crime remained a "mystery" . . .
notwithstanding the jury's guilty verdict....</p>

Sciences - 2009.</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The ability to detect fragments of deleted image files and to
reconstruct these image files from all available fragments on disk is a
key activity in the field of digital forensics. Although reconstruction
of image files from the file fragments on disk can be accomplished by
simply comparing the content of sectors on disk with the content of
known files, this brute-force approach can be time consuming.</p>
<p>This paper presents results from research into the use of Graphics
Processing Units (GPUs) in detecting specific image file byte patterns
in disk clusters. Unique identifying pattern for each disk sector is
compared against patterns in known images. A pattern match indicates the
potential presence of an image and flags the disk sector for further
in-depth examination to confirm the match. The GPU-based implementation
outperforms the software implementation by a significant margin.</p>

conclusion: "The values do not tell you what existed on the drive prior
to the wipe; they just allow you to make a guess, bit by bit. Each time
you guess, you compound the error. As recovering a single bit value has
little if any forensic value, you soon find that the cumulative errors

<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>Nowadays compressed files are very widespread and can be considered,
without any doubt, with regard to the Digital Forensic realm, an
important and precious source of probatory data. This is especially true
when in a digital investigation the examiner has to deal with corrupted
compressed files, which have been gathered in the collection phase of
the investigative process. Therefore, in the computer forensic field,
data recovery technologies are very important for acquiring useful
pieces of data which can become, in a court of low, digital evidence.
This kind of technology is used not only by law enforcement, but also by
the multitude of users in their daily activities, which justify the
relevant presence of tools in the software market which are devoted to
rescue data from damaged compressed files. However, state-of-the-art
data recovery tools have many limitations with regard to the capability
of recovering the original data, especially in the case of damaged
compressed files. So far, such recovery tools have been based on a which
controls the signature/header of the file and, thus, provides the offset
to the raw compressed data block. As a result, they cannot recover the
compressed files if the first part of the raw compressed data block,
which pertains to the header, is damaged or the signature/header block
is corrupted. Therefore, in order to deal with this issue, we have
developed a new tool capable of rescuing damaged compressed files,
according to the DEFLATE compression scheme, even though the header
block is missing or corrupted. This represents a new interesting
opportunity for the digital forensic discipline.</p>

<p>Overcoming Impediments to Cell Phone Forensics, by Wayne Jansen, Aurelien
Delaitre, and Ludovic Moenner, Proceedings of the 41st Hawaii International
Conference on System Sciences - 2008</p>
<p>Cell phones are an emerging but rapidly growing area of computer
forensics. While cell phones are becoming more like desktop computers
functionally, their organization and operation are quite different in
certain areas. For example, most cell phones do not contain a hard drive
and rely instead on flash memory for persistent storage. Cell phones are
also designed more as special purpose appliances that perform a set of
predefined tasks using proprietary embedded software, rather than
general-purpose extensible systems that run common operating system
software. Such differences make the application of classical computer
forensic techniques difficult. Also complicating the situation is the
state of the art of present day cell phone forensic tools themselves and
the way in which tools are applied. This paper identifies factors that
impede cell phone forensics and describes techniques to address two
resulting problems in particular: the limited coverage of available
phone models by forensic tools, and the inadequate means for validating
the correct functioning of forensic tools</p>

by Lt. Paul Farrell, Master's Thesis, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA, March 2009
Forensic analysis is the science of finding, examining and analyzing
evidence in support of law enforcement, regulatory compliance or
information gathering. Today, almost all digital forensic analysis is
done by humans, requiring dedicated training and consuming man-hours at
a considerable rate. As storage sizes increase and digital forensics
gain importance in investigations, the backlog of media requiring human
analysis has increased as well. This thesis tests today's
top-of-the-line commercial and open source forensic tools with the
analysis of a purpose-built Windows XP computer system containing two
users that engaged in email, chat and web browsing. It presents the
results of a pilot user study of the PyFlag forensic tool. Finally, it
presents a technique to use software to do a preliminary analysis on
media and provide a human readable report to the examiner. The goal of
the technique is to perform rapid triaging of media and allow the human
examiner to better prioritize man hours towards media with high return
on investment.</p>

ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review archive, Volume 42, Issue 3 (April 2008), Pages 93-98
The integration of strong encryption into operating systems is creating
challenges for forensic examiners, potentially preventing us from
recovering any digital evidence from a computer. Because strong
encryption cannot be circumvented without a key or passphrase, forensic
examiners may not be able to access data after a computer is shut down,
and must decide whether to perform a live forensic acquisition. In
addition, with encryption becoming integrated into the operating system,
in some cases, virtualization is the most effective approach to
performing a forensic examination of a system with FDE. This paper
presents the evolution of full disk encryption (FDE) and its impact on
digital forensics. Furthermore, by demonstrating how full disk
encryption has been dealt with in past investigations, this paper
provides forensics examiners with practical techniques for recovering
evidence that would otherwise be inaccessible.</p>

<p>Semi-Supervised Named Entity Recognition: Learning to Recognize 100 Entity Types with Little Supervision, David Nadeau, PhD Thesis, University of Ottawa, 2007.
Named Entity Recognition is the process of analyzing text documents and
automatically identifying the Who, What, Where and Whens. David Nadeau's
thesis presents a novel approach which bootstraps a named entity
recognizer using semi-structured documents on the web. Few forensic
tools use NER today, but that may well change in the future. What makes
this thesis so interesting to read is that it also has a history of the
last 20 years or so of the field. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>Increasingly memory analysis is of interest in forensic research---both
because new malware only resides in memory, and because memory analysis
is frequently the only way for analysts to get the keys that are used to
protect cryptographic file systems. In this paper the authors show that
cryptographic keys in memory are vulnerable to exploitation <em>after the
computer is turned off.</em> The authors show that the contents of dynamic
RAM are retained seconds, and sometimes minutes, after power is turned
off. By chilling the memory the data can be retained as long as
necessary. And while most laptops wipe their memory when they reboot,
the authors show that the chilled memory can be moved from one laptop
that wipes to another laptop that does not wipe. Finally, the authors
show that it is possible to find the cryptographic keys in memory and
correct random bit errors by using the AES key schedule as an
error-correction code. The authors demonstrate an attack USB stick which
reboots a computer protected with BitLocker, finds the cryptographic
keys, and then allows access to the cleartext information on the disk.</p>

abstract="The Daubert process used in the admissibility of evidence
contains major guidelines applied in assessing forensic procedures, two
of which are testing and error rates. The Digital Forensic Science (DFS)
community is growing and the error rates for the forensic tools need to
be continuously re-evaluated as the technology changes. This becomes
more difficult in the case of mobile phone forensics, because they are
proprietary. This paper discusses a database driven approach that could

testing process. This data can then be used to calculate tool error
rates, which can be published and used to validate or invalidate the

<p>extracted from a digital device without the assistance of ﬁle tables or

be found in attempting to recover ﬁles that are fragmented. In this

testing procedure to identify the fragmentation point of a ﬁle by
sequentially comparing adjacent pairs of blocks from the starting block
of a ﬁle until the fragmentation point is reached. By utilizing serial
analysis we are able to to minimize the errors in detecting the
fragmentation points. The performance results obtained from the
fragmented test-sets of DFRWS 2006 and 2007 show that the method can be
effectively used in recovery of fragmented ﬁles. clear that recovery of
fragmented ﬁles is a critical problem in forensics. ",</p>
<p>} </bibtex></p>
<p>This DFRWS 2008 article presents an improved approach for carving
fragmented JPEGs using sequential hypothesis testing. According to the
authors, "The technique begins with a header block identifying the start
of a ﬁle and then attempts to validate via SHT each subsequent block
following the header block. The fragmentation point is identiﬁed when
SHT identiﬁes a block as not belonging to the ﬁle. By utilizing this
technique, we are able to correctly and efﬁciently recover JPEG images
from the DFRWS 2006 [1] and 2007 [2] test sets even in the presence
of tens of thousands of blocks and ﬁles fragmented into 3 or more parts.
The bifragment gap carving technique enhanced with SHT allows us to
improve the performance result of DFRWS 2006 challenge test-sets,
although the technique cannot be used for DFRWS 2007. We then show how
Parallel Unique Path enhanced with SHT is able to recover all fragmented
JPEGs from DFRWS 2006 and all recoverable JPEGs from 2007 challenge
test-sets. As far as we are aware, no other automated technique can
recover multi-fragmented JPEGs from the DFRWS 2007 test set."</p>

and CRC32 algorithms and hash collisions of sectors from JPEG and WAV
files to other sectors were recorded. The analysis of the results shows
that although MD5 and SHA1 produce no false-positive indications, the
occurrence of false positives is relatively low for CRC32 and especially
CRC64. Furthermore, the CRC-based algorithms produce considerably
smaller hashes than SHA1 and MD5, thereby requiring smaller storage
capacities. CRC64 provides a good compromise between number of

<p>Authors Dandass <em>et. al</em> analyzed 528 million sectors from 433,630
unique files. They computed the CRC32, CRC64, MD5 and SHA-1 of each
sector. Not surprisingly, they find that the MD5 and SHA-1s of the
sectors are different if the sectors are different. They find 94 CRC64
collisions and 30 million CRC32 collisions. The conclusion is that, if
you are search for a single sector or building a database of single
sector hashes, you are better off building a database of CRC64s because
they are easier to store and dramatically faster to calculate than the
traditional hash functions, and they are nearly as accurate.</p>
