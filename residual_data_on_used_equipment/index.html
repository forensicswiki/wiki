even on the street.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>2006-06</strong>: A man buys a family's hard drive at a fleamarket in
  Chicago after the family's hard drive is upgraded by Best Buy.
  Apparently somebody at Best Buy violated company policy and instead of

<li>
<p><strong>2006-08-10</strong>: The University of Glamorgan in Wales purchased 317

  the 200 drives purchased from the UK market had been completely wiped.
  40% of the purchased drives didn't work. 40% came from businesses, of
  which 23% contained enough information to identify the company. 5% had
  business sensitive information. 25% came from individuals, of which
  many had pornography, and 2 had to be referred to the police for

  "Among the files were documents listing the private cell phone numbers
  of political allies, including US Senators Blanch Lincoln and Mark
  Pryor and US Representatives Marion Berry, Mike Ross and Vic Snyder.

  (\$300,000) after it sold a hard drive that contained 3,000 patient records
  (2,000 children and 900 adults). Apparently the drives were provided to a PC
  recycler on the grounds that they be destroyed. The recycler provided a
  destruction certificate, then sold the drives on eBay. A member of the public
  bought the drive, discovered what they had, and alerted the authorities.

<p>The use of computers that contain hard disks to process and store
information has been ubiquitous across organisations in both the public
and private sector for more than two decades and is being ever more
widely used by individuals in the home. During that time, the processing
capability of the computers has increased enormously. At the same time
the storage capacity of the computers has increased from tens of
Megabytes to hundreds of Gigabytes and the use of Terabyte
storage devices in both commercial and private locations is now becoming
increasingly common. In recent years, because of social change and
alterations in the way in which organisations work, there has also been
an increasing trend in the use of the same computer to process and store
both the organisation’s and the individuals personal information. It is
clear that the majority of organisations and private individuals still
remain ignorant or misinformed of the potential volume and type of
information that is stored on the hard disks contained within these
computer systems. As a result, they have not considered, or are unaware
of, the potential impact of this information becoming available to an
unintended third party.</p>
<p>This is the fourth study in an ongoing research effort that is being
conducted into the volume and type of information that remains on
computer hard disks offered for sale on the second hand market. The
research has been undertaken to gain an understanding of the level and
types of information that remains on these disks and to determine the
damage that could, potentially be caused, if the information was
misused. These studies have examined a large number of disks that have
been purchased in a number of countries. The rationale for this was to
determine whether there are any national or regional differences in the
way that computer disks are disposed of and to compare the results for
any regional or temporal trends.</p>
<p>The first study was carried out in 2005 and has been repeated annually
with the scope extended to include additional research partners and
countries during each of the subsequent years. The studies were carried
out by British Telecommunications and the University of Glamorgan in the
UK, Edith Cowan University in Australia and Longwood University in the
USA.</p>
<p>The core methodology of the research has remained the same over the
duration of the study: to acquire a number of second hand computer disks
from a range of sources and then to determine whether they still
contained information relating to a previous owner or if the device had
been effectively erased. If the disks still contained information, the
research examined whether it was in a sufficient volume and of enough
sensitivity to the original owner to represent a risk if unintentionally
exposed to a third party. One of the results of the research has been
that for a very large proportion of the disks that have been examined,
there was significant information present and both organisations and
individuals were potentially exposed to the possibility of a compromise
of sensitive information. Potential impacts of this might include
embarrassment to individuals and organisations, fraud, blackmail and
identity theft. It is noted that where the disks had originally been
owned by organisations, they had, in most cases, failed to meet their
statutory, regulatory and legal obligations.</p>
<p>In the 2008 study, the fourth in the series, the research methodology
that had been followed in the previous studies was repeated, but in
addition the scope was again broadened geographically to include disks
sourced from within France.</p>
